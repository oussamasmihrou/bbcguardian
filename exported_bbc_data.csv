1,1,Our Planet Now,Justin Rowlatt,California's fires threaten to ravage mighty sequoia forests,2022-01-01,http://www.bbc.com//news/science-environment-59842464,"California's giant sequoias are symbols of permanence - with some living for thousands of years. But the fierce wildfires ravaging the state threaten even these mighty trees, which are among the longest-lived organisms on Earth.
There is something primeval about giant sequoias. Their weird, broccoli-like branches wouldn't seem out of place with a long-necked dinosaur plodding by. 
And they are impossibly big: 30 or 40 people would have to link hands to hug the largest ones. The tallest trees are 90m (295ft) high. That's like a 30-storey tower block.
""They make you feel deep time"", sighs Christy Bingham, as she looks up at the biggest tree in the world - known as the General Sherman. 
""You can just sense standing here that this tree was born before Jesus."" 
Christy lowers her voice as she says this, as if out of respect. She's in charge of conserving these magnificent trees in the Sequoia National Park in the Sierra Nevada mountains - their last redoubt.
Sequoias live so long because they are exquisitely adapted to their environment, Christy tells me. 
There have always been fires in California and, in response, sequoias have developed insulating bark which can be up to a metre thick and which stops all but the hottest fires damaging the trees. 
But California's fires are changing. Christy leads me deeper into the forest, to show me what she means.
All you can hear is the sound of the wind in the leaves, the occasional cry of a raven and our footsteps crunching in the leaf litter. It is heaven. Until, that is, we walk over a ridge and the scene changes dramatically.
""This is what I wanted to show you, this was a giant sequoia grove"", she says. The landscape is monochrome now: grey or black, ash or cinders. Many of the huge trees have been reduced to columns of charcoal.
""Before 2015 no one saw a sequoia that looked like this,"" says Christy. She is crying now. ""You never saw a tree become a candle and burn up in this way before."" She points to the blackened remains of one of the biggest trees. 
""This 1,000- to 2,000-year-old tree should have lived another 500 to 800 years but it's gone."" 
Christy wipes her tears with the sleeve of her jacket. ""It will not sequester any more carbon. It will not be a spotted owl house. It's dead.""
It isn't just California's trees that have been suffering. Several hours' drive north we visit the Gold Rush-era town of Greenville. It used to be famous for its Wild West-style clapboard shops and its white painted church with its elegant wooden spire. 
All that is gone now, incinerated in the massive Dixie Fire this summer which burnt a million acres and cost some 600 million dollars to fight.
Nichoel Farris tells me how she got a text telling her to get out of town. An hour later the whole place - 1,500 buildings in total - had been erased, and her ""forever home"" with it.
""It took all the colour out of my life. Look, everything is just a shade of grey"", says Nichoel, gesturing towards the ashes of her house. ""We lost the future we'd planned for and built."" She's crying now. ""We lost our story"", she tells me.
But Nichoel hasn't lost all hope. She talks about how she wants to see the town rebuilt using the latest fire protection knowhow. She and her husband grew 80% of their food on their land and she hopes others will do the same. 
""Greenville could actually be a lighthouse community of sustainability and climate adaptation. And how we live in our new normal - because big fires are now the new normal,"" she says.
And, in the forest, Christy hasn't given up hope either. She expects to see baby sequoias sprouting here next year. They like burnt soil. And she says the forests need to be better managed, with dead wood and brush that can fuel fires cleared away.
What's more, a few of the trees, even here amongst the destruction, will survive. Christy starts to scrape with her fingers at the charred bark of a giant sequoia at the very edge of the grove. 
Not far in - about an inch or a couple of centimetres - and the charcoal gives way to reddish bark. ""This is just surface damage,"" she says. ""Look up at the leaves, lots of them have survived. This tree will live!""
The resilience of the sequoias should inspire us, says Christy: ""It is telling us we need to act on climate change now and that every little bit counts"". She turns to look me in the eye. 
""Every carbon reduction will help these forests persist,"" she says. And I notice her smile has returned as we walk on through the trees.

2,2,Climate change,BBC News,Colorado wildfires: Tens of thousands evacuated as blazes spread,2021-12-31,http://www.bbc.com//news/world-us-canada-59834897,"Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated and nearly 1,000 homes have been destroyed as wildfires spread through the US state of Colorado.
The fast-moving blazes are burning in Boulder County, north of Denver. Governor Jared Polis called it a ""New Year's Eve miracle"" that no deaths had been reported.
Some 30,000 people in the towns of Louisville and Superior were told to leave their homes on Thursday.
A state of emergency has been declared.
""It was in blink of an eye. This was a disaster in fast motion, all in the course of half a day,"" Governor Polis said in a news conference on Friday.
""Nearly 1,000 homes are gone,"" he added.
Winds of up to 105 mph (169 km/h) are fanning flames across the region amid a historic drought.
While previous fires in Colorado have been in rural areas, these latest blazes are burning in more suburban parts of the state. Thursday's fires, named the Marshall Fire and Middle Fork Fire, are coming relatively late in the season. 
At least some were sparked when power lines were toppled by strong winds, and they have quickly become the most destructive wildfires in the state's modern history. Experts say that wildfires in western North America have grown more intense in recent years. 
""This is our community so to watch it burn so quickly, so unexpectedly, is something that we are struggling to understand,"" said Gov Polis, who added that President Joe Biden had called to say he would sign a federal emergency declaration.
Some 370 homes went up in flames west of Superior and 210 were lost in the Old Town area of Superior, Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said.
A shopping complex and hotel were also destroyed, and about 6,000 acres were burned in total, the sheriff said. 
Snow had began falling near the fires on Friday morning, offering some reprieve to firefighters who say the remaining fires are expected to burn out shortly.
Neither of the two major hospitals in the area were affected, and all schools were ""spared"" from the flames, added Gov Polis. 
At least one first responder and six others were injured, Sheriff Pelle said, adding that more casualties were likely. 
One video taken outside a supermarket showed a dramatic scene as winds ripped through the car park.
Patrick Kilbride, 72, was at work in a hardware store when he heard the order to evacuate, The Denver Post reported. 
He rushed home but only had time to gather a few possessions before the flames engulfed the property. His pet dog and cat both died. 
""It's just a strange feeling to go from having everything to make your life comfortable to having nothing,"" he said.
Colorado has been experiencing extreme droughts in recent years. Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.
The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

3,3,Climate change,BBC News,Scotland's 100% renewables electricity target narrowly missed,2021-12-31,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-scotland-59837782,"Scotland narrowly missed a key environment target for the equivalent of 100% of electricity used in 2020 to be generated from renewable sources.
Official figures show gross consumption from renewables - minus net exports - was 98.6%
The full 2020 total was up from 97.4% in the early part of the year. 
It comes after the Scottish government missed a target for 11% of non-electrical heat to be generated by renewables in 2020.
Energy Secretary Michael Matheson said the country continued to ""lead the way"" with its commitment to be net zero by 2045.
In 2019, Scotland met 90.1% of its equivalent electricity consumption from renewables, according to Scottish government figures.
The 100% target was set in 2011, when renewable technologies generated just 37% of national demand.
Some of Scotland's electricity is sold overseas, meaning it also uses significant amounts of non-renewable electricity.
The latest full-year figures also showed:
Over the first nine months of 2021, provisional figures show generation was down 22.3% compared  with the same period in 2020.
The Scottish government said this was ""mainly due to continued mild weather over the year adversely affecting hydro and wind generation"".
According to the Energy Statistics for Scotland, electricity consumption also dropped by 5.7% from 2019 to 2020.
However, gas consumption rose slightly by 2.4% on 2019.
Scotland has some of the most ambitious climate targets in the world, with its Climate Change Bill setting out a legally-binding target of reaching net-zero emissions by 2045.
By 2030, ministers want renewable energy generation to account for 50% of energy demand across electricity, heat and transport.
Michael Matheson said he was ""proud of the progress Scotland has made over the past year"".
The energy secretary added: ""This statement shows we are continuing to make good progress with the equivalent of 98.6% of gross electricity consumption being from renewable sources in 2020, which is up from 89.8% in 2019.
""Whilst we do have many challenges ahead of us if we are going to meet our ambitious targets, we have laid the groundwork in 2021 for Scotland to take important leaps forward towards net zero.""

5,6,COP26,Martin Webber,Business Review of 2021: Climate change and Covid,2021-12-30,http://www.bbc.com//news/business-59730492,"Over the past year governments all over the world told businesses to radically step up their strategies for going green and shifting away from fossil fuels. 
The Glasgow COP 26 Climate Conference in November saw the host, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, setting out why humanity had to ""act now"".
Mr Johnson declared: ""If we don't get serious about climate change today, it will be too late for our children to do so tomorrow"".  
After the two weeks of talking in Glasgow, a draft deal pledging to ""phase out"" use of the dirtiest fuel, coal, was rejected by the biggest coal users, China and India.
But climate experts welcomed the fact that a reference to coal did stay in the final agreement, with a commitment instead to ""phase down"" coal use.  
Many established business leaders have already got the message and some have already completely changed what they do.  
The Australian mining entrepreneur, Andrew Forrest, the CEO of Fortescue Metals Group, told the BBC how his firm's large iron ore trucks and trains were being converted to so-called ""green hydrogen"".  
To make ""green hydrogen"", renewable energy - like wind power - is used to create electricity that then splits water into oxygen and hydrogen.  That hydrogen is captured to use as a fuel. In a hydrogen engine, the main emission is harmless water vapour.  
""This is the day the fossil fuel industry has denied would come. There are huge sources of green hydrogen - if the world bothers to make the transition. My own company is making the transition right now,"" he said.  
The entrepreneur said he took a four year PhD to study the environment and had learned that ""global warming is frighteningly real.""    
In April he took Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, to his vast mining operations that dig out iron ore to make the world's steel.  
Mr Forrest described how the prime minister faced ""big beefy Australian workers"" who would put an arm round Mr Morrison, saying ""come on ScoMo we're all going green, what's taking you so long? Green is the future mate"". 
A few months after that visit, Scott Morrison committed to making Australia ""net-zero"" by 2050 in line with the US, Japan, the EU and UK. 
""Net zero"" means that any climate damaging emissions are offset by emissions that are removed from the environment. 
China, Russia and Saudi Arabia are focussing on a 2060 ""net zero"" target. India's target is 2070. 
Meanwhile, in Denmark, green hydrogen is being created at a site at Brande in Jutland in the west of the country, using rows of dedicated wind turbines that tower over the countryside.  
The hydrogen is then used to fuel the vehicles of a nearby green taxi firm called DRIVR, which have chosen the hydrogen option over battery electric taxis. 
""In the taxi industry, the most important thing is time,"" Haydar Shaiwandi, chief executive of DRIVR told us. 
""We can't charge electric vehicles fast. The hydrogen vehicles actually act like regular diesel vehicles because for recharging a hydrogen vehicle is a maximum of five minutes.""  
But while change is happening, many say it is not happening fast enough.  
One big concern is that the green option is usually still the more expensive one, so most businesses still put their cash into cheaper but polluting investments. 
The fear is that without more decisive government action to change economic incentives, business and investors won't be able to deliver on the pledges set out by their nation's political leaders. 
Among those worried is Tariq Fancy, a former high flyer in the world of sustainable investing. He used to work as chief investment officer for sustainable investing at Blackrock, one of the world's largest asset managers.  
Mr Fancy says that - by law - managers like Blackrock need to maximise future retirement income for their investors. 
He argues that managers can look at environmental considerations but ""can't lose any money by investing in something that's good for the world"" because they are legally prohibited from doing that.
""Little to none of what any of the financial services industry is doing is actually - in any meaningful way - doing anything to fight climate change,"" he says. 
Because of this, he argues that the sector is therefore slower to enact reforms ""that experts are telling us we need to"".  
Mr Fancy concludes: ""All of this is what I call a deadly distraction."" 
The International Energy Agency, which is funded by governments of major western nations, made headlines in 2021 with a stark declaration. 
The IEA said that to meet governments' goal of limiting warming for the planet to an extra 1.5C, then there should be no development of any new fossil fuel fields. 
The IEA's chief energy economist Tim Gould says the world got closer to that scenario at Glasgow but ""we're not there yet"", he says. 
""In our view COP26 was all about setting ambitions. The acid test will be how quickly these are implemented. The time now is to really roll up the sleeves and put these pledges into practice."" 
For many years, Irwin Stelzer from the conservative US think-tank, the Hudson Institute, has supported a tax on carbon to encourage the private sector to invest more in green technology.
""Having waged this battle for a decade now and emerging bloody but unbowed, I would say a straight carbon tax will not pass,"" he tells me.    
But he is watching closely EU plans for a ""border tax"" on imported goods produced using ""dirty fuels"" - such as steel produced in China. 
""The EU may turn out to be one of the engines of progress, which is not its usual role. When they have border taxes, that tax imports for their carbon content, other nations will have to respond with similar taxes that will have the same effect."" 
The US will end up with its own border tax as well, Irwin Stelzer says: ""The politics is now falling in place to have some form of carbon pricing - directly or indirectly.""  
While policymakers were focussing on the long term in 2021, they also had a major job shoring up spending in the short term as the Covid pandemic hit activity for a second year. 
Most of the worst forecasts for the impact of Covid on jobs and incomes did not materialise.  Indeed most economies saw output return to levels seen before the pandemic. 
And by the end of 2021, there was growing concern about inflation set off by governments and consumers spending too much.  
Prices in the US are now 7% higher than a year ago - the fastest inflation rate since 1982.  
Ken Rogoff, former chief economist at the IMF, blames Covid-related supply chain issues in part, but says poor US government policy is also to blame.
""The stimulus - the American Rescue Plan - that the government put into place just after President Biden took office was just not well thought out or well designed.  It was throwing money at the economy - too much, too late,"" he says. 
""Frankly what they are doing now with infrastructure and social infrastructure would have done better to do back then."" 
For the big tech giants, it was another profitable year. Shares of the electric car firm, Tesla, rose 40%. Shares of Facebook (now known as Meta) were still up 20% despite a deluge of bad publicity after a former employee released internal documents.  
Frances Haugen said Facebook's own research had shown evidence of Instagram's harmful effects on some teenagers, and that the firm prioritised ""growth over safety"".  
Facebook said the leaks were misleading and said it had 40,000 people working on safety and security. 
Thanks to Covid, small business owners had a bleak time for much of 2021. But many of those that have survived now feel optimistic.  
The owner of the Aroma speciality coffee shop in Bologna in Italy, Cristina Caroli, was overcome with joy when tourists returned last summer.  
""It was literally a dream when we saw the first tourist after so long,"" she says. 
""Somebody speaking another language. It was very emotional. Americans! I couldn't believe it - then the English, the Swiss, the Germans - it was incredible it was fantastic!"" 
Cristina's enthusiasm for the future of her cafÃ© remains undimmed, telling me: ""Activities are starting again, the situation looks really better, it's a kind of renaissance after this bad period.""

6,7,Climate change,Geeta Pandey,Why I switched to eating grandma's food,2021-12-30,http://www.bbc.com//news/world-asia-india-59650408,"During my childhood visits to my ancestral home in rural Uttar Pradesh in northern India, I would often find my grandmother eating roti - flat bread - made with pearl millets or sorghum. 
She would mix the flour with water, take a chunk of the dough and beat it between her palms to make a big flat disc and then cook it on the wood-fired clay oven.
If she offered it to me, I'd turn my nose up. I couldn't comprehend why she'd choose them over thinner, tastier, easier-to-eat wheat rotis.
But a few years back, I switched to the food my grandma ate. 
I replaced wheat flour in my kitchen with flour made from pearl millets after I saw a report that said that the latter were healthier.
Even though my roti is now more chewy, I've stuck to it because it makes me feel healthier.
And I'm not alone - agriculture experts say in recent years, many ""forgotten foods"" are making a comeback in the farms and fields and also on our plates.
For a while now, there has been ""a concerted global effort"" to help millets shed their ""forgotten"" tag, says Dr Jacqueline Hughes, Director General of non-profit Icrisat (International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics).
India celebrated 2018 as Year of Millets and in March, the United Nations accepted Delhi's proposal to celebrate 2023 as the International Year of Millets.
Reports say the year would be used to raise awareness about the health benefits of millets and their suitability for cultivation - they can grow in degraded soil and need little pesticide - at a time when the world is confronted with the spectre of global warming.
Millets, Dr Hughes says, are increasingly being recognised as ""smart food"" because ""they are good for the planet, good for the farmer and good for you"".
""They require less water and grow in really hot temperatures. They are good for the farmer because they are very resilient and can survive pestilent diseases. They are good for you because they are more nutritious. Studies show that millets reduce diabetes, improve cholesterol profiles, alleviate calcium, zinc and iron deficiencies. They are also gluten free.""
Not surprising then that health experts in India are looking at millets with interest - the country is home to 80 million diabetics, over 17 million die from cardiovascular diseases every year and more than three million children are malnourished, half of them severely.  
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has talked of ""a millet revolution"" to ""stamp out malnutrition from the country"".
Experts say it's not an impossible task as millets were a staple for Indians for centuries.
Director of Indian Institute of Millet Research Vilas Tonapi says millets are ""the most ancient grains known to mankind"". 
""They were cultivated around 3000BC during the Indus Valley civilisation. Grown in 21 states, there are region and state specific millets which are part of the food culture and religious rituals.""
With the annual yield at 16 million tonnes, India remains the largest producer of millets in the world. But, in the past 50 years, Mr Tonapi says, the area under cultivation has shrunk from 38 million hectares to 13 million hectares and the share of millets in India's food basket has declined from 20% in the 1960s to 6% today.
The decline of millets began in 1969-70, Dr Tonapi says.
""Until then, India used to receive food aid and import large quantities of grains to feed its population. In a bid to attain food sufficiency and alleviate hunger, the government launched green revolution and introduced high-yielding varieties of rice and wheat.""
Between 1960 and 2015 in India, wheat production more than trebled, and rice production increased by 800% while millet production remained stagnant at low levels. 
Dr Hughes, who earlier this year was involved in the preparation of the Global Manifesto for Forgotten Foods, says ""this overemphasis on rice and wheat led to the neglect of millets and many traditional foods that fell by the wayside"". 
""Because they haven't been bred to modern tastes or are not easy to cook in today's fast-paced world, they have been under-utilised and neglected for decades. But it's terribly important to have diversity on your plate,"" she adds.
To do that, the ""forgotten"" crops will have to receive the same sort of attention given to rice and wheat and some of the other commercial crops. Experts say at least a beginning has been made where millets are concerned.
Several strategies suggested by agricultural scientists for their revival have begun to show results - Dr Tonapi says the demand for millets has grown by 146% in the past two years.
Millet cookies, chips, puffs and other munchies are being sold in supermarkets and online stores. The government is offering millets at one rupee a kg to millions through the public distribution system, and some state governments are serving ready-to-eat dishes as part of the school mid-day meal plan.
The renewed interest in coarse grains has come as a blessing for tribal communities in northern districts of Telangana state. 
P Aila is among a group of 10 tribal women in Asifabad who have been trained by Icrisat to prepare meals that are supplied to children in rural day-care centres.
Talking to me on the phone from her village, she lists the ingredients and spices that she uses in the meals and says that in August, they sold 12 tonnes of sweet and savoury dishes made with sorghum.  
Aila doesn't fully understand the interest in the humble grain that's been her staple all her life, but she tells me she's happy that it's going places.

9,10,COP26,Matt McGrath,Climate change: Hurricanes to expand into more populated regions,2021-12-29,http://www.bbc.com//news/science-environment-59775105,"Climate change will expand the range of tropical cyclones, making millions more people vulnerable to these devastating storms, a new study says.
At present, these cyclones - or hurricanes as they are also known - are mainly confined to the tropical regions north and south of the equator.
But researchers say that rising temperatures will allow these weather events to form in the mid-latitudes. 
This area includes cities such as New York, Beijing, Boston and Tokyo.
The study has been published in the journal Nature Geoscience.
The scientists involved say their work shows by the end of this century, cyclones will likely occur over a wider range than they have for three million years.
When subtropical storm Alpha made landfall in Portugal in September 2020, the relatively small scale of damage caused by the cyclone made few headlines.
But for scientists this was quite a momentous event.
""We hadn't observed this before,"" said Dr Joshua Studholme, a physicist from Yale University.
""You had a traditional kind of mid-latitude storm, that sort of decayed, and in its decay, the right conditions for a tropical cyclone to form occurred, and that hadn't happened to Portugal before.""
Dr Studholme is the lead author of this new study, which projects that a warming climate will see the formation of more of these types of storms in the mid-latitudes, where most of the world's population lives, and where most economic activity takes place.
He explained that as the world gets hotter, the difference in temperature between the equator and polar regions will decline, and this will impact the flow of the jet streams.
Normally, these high-altitude rivers of air act as a kind of border guard for hurricanes, keeping them closer to the equator.
""As the climate warms, that sort of jet stream activity that happens in the middle latitude, will weaken and in extreme cases split, allowing this sort of cyclone formation to occur.""
The question of the impact of human induced climate change on hurricanes has been contentious in the past, but recent research suggests that the connections are becoming clearer.
Last August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published the first part of its sixth assessment report, dealing with the science of a warming climate.
In relation to hurricanes and tropical cyclones, the authors said they had ""high confidence"" that the evidence of human influence has strengthened.
""The proportion of intense tropical cyclones, average peak tropical cyclone wind speeds, and peak wind speeds of the most intense tropical cyclones will increase on the global scale with increasing global warming,"" the IPCC said.
The new research published on Wednesday makes use of multiple strands of evidence to show that tropical cyclones in future are likely to occur over a wider range than previously thought.
""What we've done is make explicit the links between the physics going on within storms themselves and the dynamics of the atmosphere at the planetary scale,"" said Dr Studholme.
""This is a hard problem because this physics isn't well simulated in numerical models run on modern computers."" 
The likely expansion of these storms poses a significant danger to the world, especially when the other impacts of warming come into play.
""Tropical cyclones in the mid-latitude band could experience other changes such as slower motion and heavier rainfall,"" said Dr Gan Zhang, previously an atmospheric scientist at Princeton University and NOAA who wasn't involved in the new paper.
""These tropical cyclone changes, plus pronounced coastal sea level rise might compound potential societal impacts.""
Dr Zhang cautioned that the sensitivity of tropical cyclones to warming has a high level of uncertainty but he said the risk from these storms could still increase even with moderate levels of warming.
Certainly, the authors argue that this course is not set in stone and that dramatic reductions in carbon emissions over the next decade particularly, could alter the outcome.
""The control over this is the temperature gradient between the tropics and the poles, and that's very tightly linked to overall climate change,"" said Dr Studholme.
""By end of this century, the difference in that gradient between a high emission scenario and a low emission scenario is dramatic. That can be very significant in terms of how these hurricanes play out.""

10,11,Climate change,Jack Hunter,Alaska 'Icemageddon' warning follows heat record,2021-12-29,http://www.bbc.com//news/world-us-canada-59820999,"The coldest US state of Alaska has recorded its hottest-ever December day, amid an unusual winter warm spell.
Temperatures soared to a record 19.4C (67F) on the island of Kodiak on Sunday - almost seven degrees warmer than the state's previous high.
But elsewhere in Alaska temperatures have been plunging to record lows.
In the south-eastern town of Ketchikan, temperatures dropped to -18C (-0.4F) on 25 December - one of the town's coldest Christmas Days in the past century.
The weather extremes have prompted warnings of an ""Icemageddon"" from authorities, as torrents of rain and snow have left ice as hard as cement coating the roads.
Experts say warm air pouring in from Hawaii has made Alaska's air - usually cold and dry during December - more moist. This has meant heavy rain and snow storms are more likely in interior regions, away from the balmy coastal areas.
Heavy snowfall was followed by torrential rain that left the region coated with ice as the rain quickly froze, resulting in widespread power failures, road closures and offices being shut.
Thick ice formed on roads and made them treacherous for drivers, warned the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities.
""Ice is extremely difficult to remove once it has binded to the road surface. Even though air temps were warm... roads were at sub-zero temps, which caused ice to bind to the surface,"" the department said on Twitter.
The ice would likely cling to the roads until at least March or April, Climate Scientist Rick Thoman, of the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy, told the BBC.
The fiercest mid-winter storm since 1937 struck the central city of Fairbanks over Christmas, dumping more than 10in (25.4cm) of snow, Mr Thoman explained.
So much snow fell on Sunday it caved in the roof of the only grocery shop in the town of Delta Junction, 95 miles (153km) south-east of Fairbanks.
Mr Thoman said the blasts of extreme warm and cold temperatures over the past two decades were a sign of climate change.
""When all the pieces come together in a warming world we're going to get these unprecedented events, that's what we expect,"" he said.
The cold is set to return - temperatures in Fairbanks are forecast to drop to below -29C (-20F) this weekend. 
But warm, soggy episodes are likely to be more common in the future, Mr Thoman predicted.
""2021 really seems to be the year these extreme precipitation events have really come to the fore,"" he told the BBC.

11,12,Climate change,BBC News,Insulate Britain protests cost police more than Â£4m,2021-12-29,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-england-london-59808873,"Policing Insulate Britain's road-blocking protests over three months cost more than Â£4m, new figures have revealed.
The Met Police spent Â£4m on protests between 13 September and 20 November, according to figures released to the PA news agency under a Freedom of Information request.
Four other forces spent more than Â£300,000 combined.
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was ""appalled"" by the costs.
Insulate Britain wants the Government to insulate all UK homes by 2030 to cut carbon emissions.
It repeatedly blocked major roads between September and November, causing massive traffic disruption.
Activists also often glued their hands to the road or each other to make it harder to remove them.
The Met said 6,651 of the force's officers and staff were involved, at a cost of Â£3.1 million.
A further Â£600,000 was spent on deploying vehicles, while the overtime cost was Â£300,000, the force said.
Hertfordshire Police spent Â£185,000, Surrey Police Â£110,000, City of London Police Â£44,000 and Greater Manchester Police said it had spent Â£10,000 policing protests.
The total cost was likely to be much higher as these four forces only included overtime bills. 
For three months Insulate Britain frequently targeted the M25, the UK's busiest motorway, but also blocked roads in Manchester, Birmingham, London and the Port of Dover in Kent.
Mr Shapps said: ""I am appalled at the amount of time and public money that's been spent policing the selfish actions of Insulate Britain.
""Not only did their guerrilla tactics wreak havoc on our roads and inflict misery to thousands of motorists, but they diverted our emergency services away from vital work, costing the UK taxpayer millions in the process.""
Ken Marsh, chairman of the Met Police Federation which represents officers, described responding to the demonstrations on motorways as ""some of the most dangerous things my colleagues have had to do"".
National Highways applied for High Court injunctions to ban protests on motorways and major A roads in England after protestors repeatedly blocked junctions on the M25, some returning after being arrested and released from custody.
Ten Insulate Britain supporters have been jailed for breaching the injunctions so far, with prison sentences ranging from two to six months.
Mr Shapps is working to include new clauses in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill that creates tougher penalties for interfering with key infrastructure such as major roads. 
Insulate Britain spokeswoman Tracey Mallaghan said the group would ""much rather money was being spent on insulating homes and helping get people out of fuel poverty"".
She said they resorted to blocking roads after failing to get attention when they acted legally. 
""It seems the only way we can get air time is by annoying enough ordinary people,"" she said.
""Our government has proved time and time again they're not doing what is necessary for our children, for the future. So how can we stop?""

12,13,COP26,Matt McGrath,Climate change: Storm clouds gather after COP26,2021-12-29,http://www.bbc.com//news/science-environment-59744522,"Is the progress that was made at the COP26 Glasgow climate summit already in jeopardy because of challenges in the year ahead?
2021 was a momentous year for climate change. 
As well as a host of extreme, destructive events influenced by rising temperatures, the past 12 months have seen unprecedented political engagement on the issue, culminating in the COP26 summit in Glasgow in November.
Progress was undoubtedly made and the overall thrust of the meeting was towards more rapid action on a whole host of measures to curb emissions.
But there are now growing concerns that this momentum may dissipate over the coming months. 
The most grievous blow comes from the US.
The potential failure of President Biden to get his Build Back Better act through Congress would significantly impact the ability of the US to meet the tough climate targets that the White House has committed to.  
It would also hugely affect the relatively unified approach to climate change on display among world leaders at COP26.
""Everything that Biden pledged, led to this relatively good atmosphere and a sense of momentum in Glasgow,"" said Dr Joanna Depledge, a fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Environment, Energy and Natural Resource Governance. 
""But these were just promises, he needs to get the bill through Congress. And it's now looking increasingly dicey. He can do some things with executive orders, but that certainly isn't the kind of sustained institutional climate legislation change that we're really looking for."" 
""I think the situation to us, is critical.""
The despair among many in the US over the possible failure of President Biden's bill will also have knock-on effects throughout the world. This will certainly be the case in China, a country smarting from the perception that it flexed its political muscle in Glasgow to get its way. Biden's political difficulties with the bill are seen as more evidence that the ""West is declining"".
""I am worried 2022 will see a fuller display of geopolitical tension dominating the climate agenda,"" said Li Shuo, from Greenpeace East Asia. 
He is also concerned that the mooted introduction of carbon taxes on imported goods into Europe could elevate a sense of unfairness and frustration in Beijing.
""The Chinese side will see how they are treated vis-a-vis others and make its judgment on whether the game is fair, and most importantly, if it is about the environment at all, or just geopolitics and trade,"" he told BBC News. Overall, I am looking at a more turbulent year ahead. The years before the Paris agreement were an example of geopolitics helping the climate agenda forward. What lies ahead may be the opposite.""
This pessimistic outlook is echoed by the fact that next year's COP is being held in Egypt, and the one after that in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). 
""Neither of these countries could be described as climate leaders,"" said Prof J Timmons Roberts from Brown University in Rhode Island, US. The good side is that COP27 will be in a developing country, and some issues like loss and damage [who pays for the impact of climate change in the worst affected countries, and how it is paid] may get more traction, but on the issue of emissions reductions, it's not clear that they're going to be leaders.""
Another key concern heading into 2022 is that some countries may simply ignore aspects of the Glasgow climate pact that they don't like. 
One key measure in the deal was the request for all countries to ""revisit and strengthen"" their national climate pledges by the time delegates gather in Egypt late in 2022. 
Despite agreeing to this, a number of countries now say they simply won't update their plans, among them Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand's climate minister James Shaw told national media that this provision really only applied to large emitters like India, China, Russia and Brazil which hadn't significantly strengthened their plans in time for Glasgow.
However, there are also some positive developments in the offing that could make a significant difference to the general mood around climate change.
During COP26, the UK, EU, US, Germany and France agreed to pay $8.5bn to help South Africa abandon coal. Now, those close to the negotiations say that two new deals to help India and Indonesia move away from the most carbon-intensive energy source are in the pipeline.
These will be expensive, running into the tens of billions, but if they happen, they would represent a massive step away from fossil fuels. These types of arrangements, and the commitment to doubling adaptation finance made by richer countries will be key to progress in 2022, say officials. 
Another positive is that the UK's presidency continues right up to next November when Egypt takes over. 
COP26 President Alok Sharma has made it clear that he intends to push forward over the coming months in efforts to ensure that the agreements secured in Glasgow on deforestation, coal, finance and cars will start to be implemented. 
Mr Sharma's background as an auditor will come in handy in making sure there's no slippage over the integrity of the commitments made. 
""The UK, as hosts of COP26, spent the last two years working tirelessly with countries to build trust, which ultimately allowed us to deliver the Glasgow climate pact,"" he told BBC News. ""We will continue in the same vein through 2022 to make sure countries keep their promises, re-visit their emissions reductions targets, get finance flowing, and deliver on the many commitments made during the two weeks of the summit.""
Another positive is the fact that Germany will chair the G7 group of countries. The co-leader of the German Green party is now the country's foreign minister, so climate will remain high on the international diplomatic agenda. 
Infrastructure investment in the wake of the Covid pandemic, especially in middle income countries, also offers a great chance to lock in significant action to limit emissions. 
The final agreement on the rules for carbon markets, agreed in Glasgow, has coincided with a record rise in the price of carbon permits in Europe and the UK. 
While this has downsides, a sustained high carbon price could significantly speed up a transition to cleaner sources of energy.
But, as ever, global events could see all these potential positives quickly pale. 
Disputes between Russia and Ukraine, China's disengagement and a drubbing for the Democrats in mid-term elections in the US could all derail or at least delay any further progress on climate change. 
And stalling or taking small steps right now would be a disaster for efforts to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century.
""Right now, incremental steps are a death sentence,"" said Prof Roberts. 
However, the climate negotiations process is highly unpredictable - and even when things appear to be at their darkest, countries are often able to make sufficient compromises to keep things moving forward. 
Certainly the COP26 president says he's determined to push ahead and that the UK can be a role model for others.
""Leaving COP26 with the Glasgow climate pact was a historic moment demonstrating the world's shared commitment to taking real climate action,"" said Alok Sharma.
""As we look ahead, the most pressing issue is the timescale on when this action takes place and the reality is that the world needs to act at a much faster pace.""
""I believe we will reach a net zero world, and the UK is leading the way through our own actions such as rapidly expanding our renewables sector and working to eliminate the use of coal from our electricity generation in 2024, the question is whether that will be fast enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change.""
