0,2,Climate change,BBC News,Colorado wildfires: Tens of thousands evacuated as blazes spread,2021-12-31,http://www.bbc.com//news/world-us-canada-59834897,"Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated and hundreds of homes have been destroyed as wildfires spread through the US state of Colorado.
The fast-moving fires are burning in Boulder County, north of Denver, and officials say deaths and injuries are likely as the blazes spread further.
Some 30,000 people in the towns of Louisville and Superior were told to leave their homes on Thursday.
Meanwhile, a state of emergency has been declared by Governor Jared Polis.
""This fire is not so much a question of resources,"" he told a press conference. ""This fire is a force of nature.""
""We hope that the winds die down, that the weather changes,"" he added. ""But for those who are directly affected, know that you don't stand alone.""
Winds of up to 105 mph (169 kph) are sweeping flames across the region following a historic drought.
And while previous fires in Colorado have been in rural areas, these latest blazes are taking place in more suburban parts of the state. 
At least some were sparked when power lines were toppled by strong winds, and they have quickly become the most destructive wildfires in the modern history of the state.
Some 370 homes went up in flames west of Superior and 210 were lost in the Old Town area of Superior, Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said.
A shopping complex and hotel were also fully engulfed. 
At least one first responder and six others were injured, Sheriff Pelle said, adding that more casualties were likely. 
One video taken outside a supermarket showed a dramatic scene as winds ripped through the car park.
Patrick Kilbride, 72, was at work in a hardware store when he heard the order to evacuate, The Denver Post reported. 
He rushed home but only had time to gather a few possessions before the flames engulfed the property. His pet dog and cat both died. 
""It's just a strange feeling to go from having everything to make your life comfortable to having nothing,"" he said.
Colorado has been experiencing extreme droughts in recent years. Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.
The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

1,3,COP26,Martin Webber,Business Review of 2021: Climate change and Covid,2021-12-30,http://www.bbc.com//news/business-59730492,"Over the past year governments all over the world told businesses to radically step up their strategies for going green and shifting away from fossil fuels. 
The Glasgow COP 26 Climate Conference in November saw the host, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, setting out why humanity had to ""act now"".
Mr Johnson declared: ""If we don't get serious about climate change today, it will be too late for our children to do so tomorrow"".  
After the two weeks of talking in Glasgow, a draft deal pledging to ""phase out"" use of the dirtiest fuel, coal, was rejected by the biggest coal users, China and India.
But climate experts welcomed the fact that a reference to coal did stay in the final agreement, with a commitment instead to ""phase down"" coal use.  
Many established business leaders have already got the message and some have already completely changed what they do.  
The Australian mining entrepreneur, Andrew Forrest, the CEO of Fortescue Metals Group, told the BBC how his firm's large iron ore trucks and trains were being converted to so-called ""green hydrogen"".  
To make ""green hydrogen"", renewable energy - like wind power - is used to create electricity that then splits water into oxygen and hydrogen.  That hydrogen is captured to use as a fuel. In a hydrogen engine, the main emission is harmless water vapour.  
""This is the day the fossil fuel industry has denied would come. There are huge sources of green hydrogen - if the world bothers to make the transition. My own company is making the transition right now,"" he said.  
The entrepreneur said he took a four year PhD to study the environment and had learned that ""global warming is frighteningly real.""    
In April he took Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, to his vast mining operations that dig out iron ore to make the world's steel.  
Mr Forrest described how the prime minister faced ""big beefy Australian workers"" who would put an arm round Mr Morrison, saying ""come on ScoMo we're all going green, what's taking you so long? Green is the future mate"". 
A few months after that visit, Scott Morrison committed to making Australia ""net-zero"" by 2050 in line with the US, Japan, the EU and UK. 
""Net zero"" means that any climate damaging emissions are offset by emissions that are removed from the environment. 
China, Russia and Saudi Arabia are focussing on a 2060 ""net zero"" target. India's target is 2070. 
Meanwhile, in Denmark, green hydrogen is being created at a site at Brande in Jutland in the west of the country, using rows of dedicated wind turbines that tower over the countryside.  
The hydrogen is then used to fuel the vehicles of a nearby green taxi firm called DRIVR, which have chosen the hydrogen option over battery electric taxis. 
""In the taxi industry, the most important thing is time,"" Haydar Shaiwandi, chief executive of DRIVR told us. 
""We can't charge electric vehicles fast. The hydrogen vehicles actually act like regular diesel vehicles because for recharging a hydrogen vehicle is a maximum of five minutes.""  
But while change is happening, many say it is not happening fast enough.  
One big concern is that the green option is usually still the more expensive one, so most businesses still put their cash into cheaper but polluting investments. 
The fear is that without more decisive government action to change economic incentives, business and investors won't be able to deliver on the pledges set out by their nation's political leaders. 
Among those worried is Tariq Fancy, a former high flyer in the world of sustainable investing. He used to work as chief investment officer for sustainable investing at Blackrock, one of the world's largest asset managers.  
Mr Fancy says that - by law - managers like Blackrock need to maximise future retirement income for their investors. 
He argues that managers can look at environmental considerations but ""can't lose any money by investing in something that's good for the world"" because they are legally prohibited from doing that.
""Little to none of what any of the financial services industry is doing is actually - in any meaningful way - doing anything to fight climate change,"" he says. 
Because of this, he argues that the sector is therefore slower to enact reforms ""that experts are telling us we need to"".  
Mr Fancy concludes: ""All of this is what I call a deadly distraction."" 
The International Energy Agency, which is funded by governments of major western nations, made headlines in 2021 with a stark declaration. 
The IEA said that to meet governments' goal of limiting warming for the planet to an extra 1.5C, then there should be no development of any new fossil fuel fields. 
The IEA's chief energy economist Tim Gould says the world got closer to that scenario at Glasgow but ""we're not there yet"", he says. 
""In our view COP26 was all about setting ambitions. The acid test will be how quickly these are implemented. The time now is to really roll up the sleeves and put these pledges into practice."" 
For many years, Irwin Stelzer from the conservative US think-tank, the Hudson Institute, has supported a tax on carbon to encourage the private sector to invest more in green technology.
""Having waged this battle for a decade now and emerging bloody but unbowed, I would say a straight carbon tax will not pass,"" he tells me.    
But he is watching closely EU plans for a ""border tax"" on imported goods produced using ""dirty fuels"" - such as steel produced in China. 
""The EU may turn out to be one of the engines of progress, which is not its usual role. When they have border taxes, that tax imports for their carbon content, other nations will have to respond with similar taxes that will have the same effect."" 
The US will end up with its own border tax as well, Irwin Stelzer says: ""The politics is now falling in place to have some form of carbon pricing - directly or indirectly.""  
While policymakers were focussing on the long term in 2021, they also had a major job shoring up spending in the short term as the Covid pandemic hit activity for a second year. 
Most of the worst forecasts for the impact of Covid on jobs and incomes did not materialise.  Indeed most economies saw output return to levels seen before the pandemic. 
And by the end of 2021, there was growing concern about inflation set off by governments and consumers spending too much.  
Prices in the US are now 7% higher than a year ago - the fastest inflation rate since 1982.  
Ken Rogoff, former chief economist at the IMF, blames Covid-related supply chain issues in part, but says poor US government policy is also to blame.
""The stimulus - the American Rescue Plan - that the government put into place just after President Biden took office was just not well thought out or well designed.  It was throwing money at the economy - too much, too late,"" he says. 
""Frankly what they are doing now with infrastructure and social infrastructure would have done better to do back then."" 
For the big tech giants, it was another profitable year. Shares of the electric car firm, Tesla, rose 40%. Shares of Facebook (now known as Meta) were still up 20% despite a deluge of bad publicity after a former employee released internal documents.  
Frances Haugen said Facebook's own research had shown evidence of Instagram's harmful effects on some teenagers, and that the firm prioritised ""growth over safety"".  
Facebook said the leaks were misleading and said it had 40,000 people working on safety and security. 
Thanks to Covid, small business owners had a bleak time for much of 2021. But many of those that have survived now feel optimistic.  
The owner of the Aroma speciality coffee shop in Bologna in Italy, Cristina Caroli, was overcome with joy when tourists returned last summer.  
""It was literally a dream when we saw the first tourist after so long,"" she says. 
""Somebody speaking another language. It was very emotional. Americans! I couldn't believe it - then the English, the Swiss, the Germans - it was incredible it was fantastic!"" 
Cristina's enthusiasm for the future of her cafÃ© remains undimmed, telling me: ""Activities are starting again, the situation looks really better, it's a kind of renaissance after this bad period.""

2,4,Climate change,Geeta Pandey,Why I switched to eating grandma's food,2021-12-30,http://www.bbc.com//news/world-asia-india-59650408,"During my childhood visits to my ancestral home in rural Uttar Pradesh in northern India, I would often find my grandmother eating roti - flat bread - made with pearl millets or sorghum. 
She would mix the flour with water, take a chunk of the dough and beat it between her palms to make a big flat disc and then cook it on the wood-fired clay oven.
If she offered it to me, I'd turn my nose up. I couldn't comprehend why she'd choose them over thinner, tastier, easier-to-eat wheat rotis.
But a few years back, I switched to the food my grandma ate. 
I replaced wheat flour in my kitchen with flour made from pearl millets after I saw a report that said that the latter were healthier.
Even though my roti is now more chewy, I've stuck to it because it makes me feel healthier.
And I'm not alone - agriculture experts say in recent years, many ""forgotten foods"" are making a comeback in the farms and fields and also on our plates.
For a while now, there has been ""a concerted global effort"" to help millets shed their ""forgotten"" tag, says Dr Jacqueline Hughes, Director General of non-profit Icrisat (International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics).
India celebrated 2018 as Year of Millets and in March, the United Nations accepted Delhi's proposal to celebrate 2023 as the International Year of Millets.
Reports say the year would be used to raise awareness about the health benefits of millets and their suitability for cultivation - they can grow in degraded soil and need little pesticide - at a time when the world is confronted with the spectre of global warming.
Millets, Dr Hughes says, are increasingly being recognised as ""smart food"" because ""they are good for the planet, good for the farmer and good for you"".
""They require less water and grow in really hot temperatures. They are good for the farmer because they are very resilient and can survive pestilent diseases. They are good for you because they are more nutritious. Studies show that millets reduce diabetes, improve cholesterol profiles, alleviate calcium, zinc and iron deficiencies. They are also gluten free.""
Not surprising then that health experts in India are looking at millets with interest - the country is home to 80 million diabetics, over 17 million die from cardiovascular diseases every year and more than three million children are malnourished, half of them severely.  
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has talked of ""a millet revolution"" to ""stamp out malnutrition from the country"".
Experts say it's not an impossible task as millets were a staple for Indians for centuries.
Director of Indian Institute of Millet Research Vilas Tonapi says millets are ""the most ancient grains known to mankind"". 
""They were cultivated around 3000BC during the Indus Valley civilisation. Grown in 21 states, there are region and state specific millets which are part of the food culture and religious rituals.""
With the annual yield at 16 million tonnes, India remains the largest producer of millets in the world. But, in the past 50 years, Mr Tonapi says, the area under cultivation has shrunk from 38 million hectares to 13 million hectares and the share of millets in India's food basket has declined from 20% in the 1960s to 6% today.
The decline of millets began in 1969-70, Dr Tonapi says.
""Until then, India used to receive food aid and import large quantities of grains to feed its population. In a bid to attain food sufficiency and alleviate hunger, the government launched green revolution and introduced high-yielding varieties of rice and wheat.""
Between 1960 and 2015 in India, wheat production more than trebled, and rice production increased by 800% while millet production remained stagnant at low levels. 
Dr Hughes, who earlier this year was involved in the preparation of the Global Manifesto for Forgotten Foods, says ""this overemphasis on rice and wheat led to the neglect of millets and many traditional foods that fell by the wayside"". 
""Because they haven't been bred to modern tastes or are not easy to cook in today's fast-paced world, they have been under-utilised and neglected for decades. But it's terribly important to have diversity on your plate,"" she adds.
To do that, the ""forgotten"" crops will have to receive the same sort of attention given to rice and wheat and some of the other commercial crops. Experts say at least a beginning has been made where millets are concerned.
Several strategies suggested by agricultural scientists for their revival have begun to show results - Dr Tonapi says the demand for millets has grown by 146% in the past two years.
Millet cookies, chips, puffs and other munchies are being sold in supermarkets and online stores. The government is offering millets at one rupee a kg to millions through the public distribution system, and some state governments are serving ready-to-eat dishes as part of the school mid-day meal plan.
The renewed interest in coarse grains has come as a blessing for tribal communities in northern districts of Telangana state. 
P Aila is among a group of 10 tribal women in Asifabad who have been trained by Icrisat to prepare meals that are supplied to children in rural day-care centres.
Talking to me on the phone from her village, she lists the ingredients and spices that she uses in the meals and says that in August, they sold 12 tonnes of sweet and savoury dishes made with sorghum.  
Aila doesn't fully understand the interest in the humble grain that's been her staple all her life, but she tells me she's happy that it's going places.

5,7,COP26,Matt McGrath,Climate change: Hurricanes to expand into more populated regions,2021-12-29,http://www.bbc.com//news/science-environment-59775105,"Climate change will expand the range of tropical cyclones, making millions more people vulnerable to these devastating storms, a new study says.
At present, these cyclones - or hurricanes as they are also known - are mainly confined to the tropical regions north and south of the equator.
But researchers say that rising temperatures will allow these weather events to form in the mid-latitudes. 
This area includes cities such as New York, Beijing, Boston and Tokyo.
The study has been published in the journal Nature Geoscience.
The scientists involved say their work shows by the end of this century, cyclones will likely occur over a wider range than they have for three million years.
When subtropical storm Alpha made landfall in Portugal in September 2020, the relatively small scale of damage caused by the cyclone made few headlines.
But for scientists this was quite a momentous event.
""We hadn't observed this before,"" said Dr Joshua Studholme, a physicist from Yale University.
""You had a traditional kind of mid-latitude storm, that sort of decayed, and in its decay, the right conditions for a tropical cyclone to form occurred, and that hadn't happened to Portugal before.""
Dr Studholme is the lead author of this new study, which projects that a warming climate will see the formation of more of these types of storms in the mid-latitudes, where most of the world's population lives, and where most economic activity takes place.
He explained that as the world gets hotter, the difference in temperature between the equator and polar regions will decline, and this will impact the flow of the jet streams.
Normally, these high-altitude rivers of air act as a kind of border guard for hurricanes, keeping them closer to the equator.
""As the climate warms, that sort of jet stream activity that happens in the middle latitude, will weaken and in extreme cases split, allowing this sort of cyclone formation to occur.""
The question of the impact of human induced climate change on hurricanes has been contentious in the past, but recent research suggests that the connections are becoming clearer.
Last August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published the first part of its sixth assessment report, dealing with the science of a warming climate.
In relation to hurricanes and tropical cyclones, the authors said they had ""high confidence"" that the evidence of human influence has strengthened.
""The proportion of intense tropical cyclones, average peak tropical cyclone wind speeds, and peak wind speeds of the most intense tropical cyclones will increase on the global scale with increasing global warming,"" the IPCC said.
The new research published on Wednesday makes use of multiple strands of evidence to show that tropical cyclones in future are likely to occur over a wider range than previously thought.
""What we've done is make explicit the links between the physics going on within storms themselves and the dynamics of the atmosphere at the planetary scale,"" said Dr Studholme.
""This is a hard problem because this physics isn't well simulated in numerical models run on modern computers."" 
The likely expansion of these storms poses a significant danger to the world, especially when the other impacts of warming come into play.
""Tropical cyclones in the mid-latitude band could experience other changes such as slower motion and heavier rainfall,"" said Dr Gan Zhang, previously an atmospheric scientist at Princeton University and NOAA who wasn't involved in the new paper.
""These tropical cyclone changes, plus pronounced coastal sea level rise might compound potential societal impacts.""
Dr Zhang cautioned that the sensitivity of tropical cyclones to warming has a high level of uncertainty but he said the risk from these storms could still increase even with moderate levels of warming.
Certainly, the authors argue that this course is not set in stone and that dramatic reductions in carbon emissions over the next decade particularly, could alter the outcome.
""The control over this is the temperature gradient between the tropics and the poles, and that's very tightly linked to overall climate change,"" said Dr Studholme.
""By end of this century, the difference in that gradient between a high emission scenario and a low emission scenario is dramatic. That can be very significant in terms of how these hurricanes play out.""

6,8,Climate change,Jack Hunter,Alaska 'Icemageddon' warning follows heat record,2021-12-29,http://www.bbc.com//news/world-us-canada-59820999,"The coldest US state of Alaska has recorded its hottest-ever December day, amid an unusual winter warm spell.
Temperatures soared to a record 19.4C (67F) on the island of Kodiak on Sunday - almost seven degrees warmer than the state's previous high.
But elsewhere in Alaska temperatures have been plunging to record lows.
In the south-eastern town of Ketchikan, temperatures dropped to -18C (-0.4F) on 25 December - one of the town's coldest Christmas Days in the past century.
The weather extremes have prompted warnings of an ""Icemageddon"" from authorities, as torrents of rain and snow have left ice as hard as cement coating the roads.
Experts say warm air pouring in from Hawaii has made Alaska's air - usually cold and dry during December - more moist. This has meant heavy rain and snow storms are more likely in interior regions, away from the balmy coastal areas.
Heavy snowfall was followed by torrential rain that left the region coated with ice as the rain quickly froze, resulting in widespread power failures, road closures and offices being shut.
Thick ice formed on roads and made them treacherous for drivers, warned the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities.
""Ice is extremely difficult to remove once it has binded to the road surface. Even though air temps were warm... roads were at sub-zero temps, which caused ice to bind to the surface,"" the department said on Twitter.
The ice would likely cling to the roads until at least March or April, Climate Scientist Rick Thoman, of the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy, told the BBC.
The fiercest mid-winter storm since 1937 struck the central city of Fairbanks over Christmas, dumping more than 10in (25.4cm) of snow, Mr Thoman explained.
So much snow fell on Sunday it caved in the roof of the only grocery shop in the town of Delta Junction, 95 miles (153km) south-east of Fairbanks.
Mr Thoman said the blasts of extreme warm and cold temperatures over the past two decades were a sign of climate change.
""When all the pieces come together in a warming world we're going to get these unprecedented events, that's what we expect,"" he said.
The cold is set to return - temperatures in Fairbanks are forecast to drop to below -29C (-20F) this weekend. 
But warm, soggy episodes are likely to be more common in the future, Mr Thoman predicted.
""2021 really seems to be the year these extreme precipitation events have really come to the fore,"" he told the BBC.

7,9,Climate change,BBC News,Insulate Britain protests cost police more than Â£4m,2021-12-29,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-england-london-59808873,"Policing Insulate Britain's road-blocking protests over three months cost more than Â£4m, new figures have revealed.
The Met Police spent Â£4m on protests between 13 September and 20 November, according to figures released to the PA news agency under a Freedom of Information request.
Four other forces spent more than Â£300,000 combined.
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was ""appalled"" by the costs.
Insulate Britain wants the Government to insulate all UK homes by 2030 to cut carbon emissions.
It repeatedly blocked major roads between September and November, causing massive traffic disruption.
Activists also often glued their hands to the road or each other to make it harder to remove them.
The Met said 6,651 of the force's officers and staff were involved, at a cost of Â£3.1 million.
A further Â£600,000 was spent on deploying vehicles, while the overtime cost was Â£300,000, the force said.
Hertfordshire Police spent Â£185,000, Surrey Police Â£110,000, City of London Police Â£44,000 and Greater Manchester Police said it had spent Â£10,000 policing protests.
The total cost was likely to be much higher as these four forces only included overtime bills. 
For three months Insulate Britain frequently targeted the M25, the UK's busiest motorway, but also blocked roads in Manchester, Birmingham, London and the Port of Dover in Kent.
Mr Shapps said: ""I am appalled at the amount of time and public money that's been spent policing the selfish actions of Insulate Britain.
""Not only did their guerrilla tactics wreak havoc on our roads and inflict misery to thousands of motorists, but they diverted our emergency services away from vital work, costing the UK taxpayer millions in the process.""
Ken Marsh, chairman of the Met Police Federation which represents officers, described responding to the demonstrations on motorways as ""some of the most dangerous things my colleagues have had to do"".
National Highways applied for High Court injunctions to ban protests on motorways and major A roads in England after protestors repeatedly blocked junctions on the M25, some returning after being arrested and released from custody.
Ten Insulate Britain supporters have been jailed for breaching the injunctions so far, with prison sentences ranging from two to six months.
Mr Shapps is working to include new clauses in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill that creates tougher penalties for interfering with key infrastructure such as major roads. 
Insulate Britain spokeswoman Tracey Mallaghan said the group would ""much rather money was being spent on insulating homes and helping get people out of fuel poverty"".
She said they resorted to blocking roads after failing to get attention when they acted legally. 
""It seems the only way we can get air time is by annoying enough ordinary people,"" she said.
""Our government has proved time and time again they're not doing what is necessary for our children, for the future. So how can we stop?""

2021 was a momentous year for climate change. 
As well as a host of extreme, destructive events influenced by rising temperatures, the past 12 months have seen unprecedented political engagement on the issue, culminating in the COP26 summit in Glasgow in November.
Progress was undoubtedly made and the overall thrust of the meeting was towards more rapid action on a whole host of measures to curb emissions.
But there are now growing concerns that this momentum may dissipate over the coming months. 
The most grievous blow comes from the US.
The potential failure of President Biden to get his Build Back Better act through Congress would significantly impact the ability of the US to meet the tough climate targets that the White House has committed to.  
It would also hugely affect the relatively unified approach to climate change on display among world leaders at COP26.
""Everything that Biden pledged, led to this relatively good atmosphere and a sense of momentum in Glasgow,"" said Dr Joanna Depledge, a fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Environment, Energy and Natural Resource Governance. 
""But these were just promises, he needs to get the bill through Congress. And it's now looking increasingly dicey. He can do some things with executive orders, but that certainly isn't the kind of sustained institutional climate legislation change that we're really looking for."" 
""I think the situation to us, is critical.""
The despair among many in the US over the possible failure of President Biden's bill will also have knock-on effects throughout the world. This will certainly be the case in China, a country smarting from the perception that it flexed its political muscle in Glasgow to get its way. Biden's political difficulties with the bill are seen as more evidence that the ""West is declining"".
""I am worried 2022 will see a fuller display of geopolitical tension dominating the climate agenda,"" said Li Shuo, from Greenpeace East Asia. 
He is also concerned that the mooted introduction of carbon taxes on imported goods into Europe could elevate a sense of unfairness and frustration in Beijing.
""The Chinese side will see how they are treated vis-a-vis others and make its judgment on whether the game is fair, and most importantly, if it is about the environment at all, or just geopolitics and trade,"" he told BBC News. Overall, I am looking at a more turbulent year ahead. The years before the Paris agreement were an example of geopolitics helping the climate agenda forward. What lies ahead may be the opposite.""
This pessimistic outlook is echoed by the fact that next year's COP is being held in Egypt, and the one after that in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). 
""Neither of these countries could be described as climate leaders,"" said Prof J Timmons Roberts from Brown University in Rhode Island, US. The good side is that COP27 will be in a developing country, and some issues like loss and damage [who pays for the impact of climate change in the worst affected countries, and how it is paid] may get more traction, but on the issue of emissions reductions, it's not clear that they're going to be leaders.""
Another key concern heading into 2022 is that some countries may simply ignore aspects of the Glasgow climate pact that they don't like. 
One key measure in the deal was the request for all countries to ""revisit and strengthen"" their national climate pledges by the time delegates gather in Egypt late in 2022. 
Despite agreeing to this, a number of countries now say they simply won't update their plans, among them Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand's climate minister James Shaw told national media that this provision really only applied to large emitters like India, China, Russia and Brazil which hadn't significantly strengthened their plans in time for Glasgow.
However, there are also some positive developments in the offing that could make a significant difference to the general mood around climate change.
During COP26, the UK, EU, US, Germany and France agreed to pay $8.5bn to help South Africa abandon coal. Now, those close to the negotiations say that two new deals to help India and Indonesia move away from the most carbon-intensive energy source are in the pipeline.
These will be expensive, running into the tens of billions, but if they happen, they would represent a massive step away from fossil fuels. These types of arrangements, and the commitment to doubling adaptation finance made by richer countries will be key to progress in 2022, say officials. 
Another positive is that the UK's presidency continues right up to next November when Egypt takes over. 
COP26 President Alok Sharma has made it clear that he intends to push forward over the coming months in efforts to ensure that the agreements secured in Glasgow on deforestation, coal, finance and cars will start to be implemented. 
Mr Sharma's background as an auditor will come in handy in making sure there's no slippage over the integrity of the commitments made. 
""The UK, as hosts of COP26, spent the last two years working tirelessly with countries to build trust, which ultimately allowed us to deliver the Glasgow climate pact,"" he told BBC News. ""We will continue in the same vein through 2022 to make sure countries keep their promises, re-visit their emissions reductions targets, get finance flowing, and deliver on the many commitments made during the two weeks of the summit.""
Another positive is the fact that Germany will chair the G7 group of countries. The co-leader of the German Green party is now the country's foreign minister, so climate will remain high on the international diplomatic agenda. 
Infrastructure investment in the wake of the Covid pandemic, especially in middle income countries, also offers a great chance to lock in significant action to limit emissions. 
The final agreement on the rules for carbon markets, agreed in Glasgow, has coincided with a record rise in the price of carbon permits in Europe and the UK. 
While this has downsides, a sustained high carbon price could significantly speed up a transition to cleaner sources of energy.
But, as ever, global events could see all these potential positives quickly pale. 
Disputes between Russia and Ukraine, China's disengagement and a drubbing for the Democrats in mid-term elections in the US could all derail or at least delay any further progress on climate change. 
And stalling or taking small steps right now would be a disaster for efforts to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century.
""Right now, incremental steps are a death sentence,"" said Prof Roberts. 
However, the climate negotiations process is highly unpredictable - and even when things appear to be at their darkest, countries are often able to make sufficient compromises to keep things moving forward. 
Certainly the COP26 president says he's determined to push ahead and that the UK can be a role model for others.
""Leaving COP26 with the Glasgow climate pact was a historic moment demonstrating the world's shared commitment to taking real climate action,"" said Alok Sharma.
""As we look ahead, the most pressing issue is the timescale on when this action takes place and the reality is that the world needs to act at a much faster pace.""
""I believe we will reach a net zero world, and the UK is leading the way through our own actions such as rapidly expanding our renewables sector and working to eliminate the use of coal from our electricity generation in 2024, the question is whether that will be fast enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change.""

9,11,Climate change,BBC News,More young drivers choosing to learn on automatic cars,2021-12-28,http://www.bbc.com//news/newsbeat-59803133,"The number of young drivers choosing to take their tests in automatic cars has tripled since 2008 according to the DVSA.
Only 3.8% of tests were taken in an automatic back then, but now it's closer to 14%. 
President of the AA Edmund King says it's because young people want to drive electric cars, which are automatic.
They say they'll be introducing electric car driving lessons in 2022.
Lessons will focus on how to conserve battery and drive with one pedal, instead of learning clutch control and how to change gears. 
AA and the BSM driving schools successfully trialled electric car lessons last year and will now both give instructors the option of leasing an electric car. 
It could also mean changes to driving tests in the near future as a way of keeping up to date with changing car technology.
DVSA's Deputy Chief driving examiner Gordon Witherspoon told Auto Express magazine earlier this year ""we constantly review tests for all vehicle types"" and ""take account of changes in driving habits"". 
He said the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency had already started to look at how to include electric cars in learner assessments. 
Petrol and diesel cars won't be allowed to be sold in the UK after 2030, meaning electric car sales will increase.
The biggest barrier for young people is still the price of buying and insuring an electric car - the cheapest in the UK being just over Â£17,000 new. 
Tom Webster is a motoring journalist. He says although electric cars can save you money in the long run, they aren't affordable on a budget yet. 
Because they're relatively new, there isn't a big market for second-hand electric cars.
""The traditional small car that first time buyers are looking at, only a couple of them have recently started going electric"", he tells Newsbeat.
""They are expensive to buy brand new, and it's going to take time for them to come down in price to the extent that young drivers will be able to afford them.""
Once they have eventually gone through he ""depreciation process"", it might be more achievable for more young drivers to get hold of electric cars at an affordable price.
But, Tom says, the change over to electric cars is a very gradual process. 
He says petrol and diesel cars are not ""going away overnight"", and in the meantime it could be a little more challenging to use one, because charging points are more inaccessible than petrol stations.
""A lot of young people live in towns and cities, a lot of towns and cities don't have off street parking, so it's very hard to get your own charging point at home that you'll always be able to rely on.""
If you don't have a home charging point, Tom says finding a public charging point which works and is free can be ""challenging"".
A government grant of Â£1,500 is available if you want to buy a new electric car under Â£32,000. 
Edmund King  told The Telegraph that ""there is still a reluctance"" for young people to make that commitment for those reasons, but hopes that will change in the near future.

10,12,Climate change,Sarbas Nazari,Crocodiles turn on humans amid Iran water crisis,2021-12-28,http://www.bbc.com//news/world-middle-east-59571711,"Lying on the floor of his modest home, Siahouk was in excruciating pain from the injury to his right hand, the result of a nightmarish encounter. Just two days earlier, on a scorchingly hot August afternoon, the frail 70-year-old shepherd had gone to fetch water from a pond when he was pounced on by a gando, the local name for a mugger crocodile in Iran's Baluchistan region.  
""I didn't see it coming,"" he remembers of the traumatic event two years ago, with the shock and disbelief still vivid in his eyes.  
Siahouk was only able to escape once he ""managed to squeeze the plastic [water] bottle in between its jaws"", he says, reliving the moment as he rubs his bony face with his wrinkled left hand.  
The blood loss left Siahouk unconscious for half an hour. He was only found after his flock of sheep returned unaccompanied to his tiny village of Dombak.
Siahouk's account echoes that of many other victims, mostly children. More often than not, emotive headlines about Baluchi kids suffering grisly wounds inundate Iranian media, yet quickly disappear. 
In 2016, a nine-year-old called Alireza was swallowed by one such crocodile. And in July 2019, Hawa, 10, lost her right arm in an attack. Collecting water for laundry, she was almost dragged in by the crocodile before she was saved by her companions in a tug of war.  
The attacks have come at a time when Iran has been suffering acute water shortages and, consequentially, fast-shrinking natural habitats have seen the gandos' food supplies dry up. The starving animals treat humans approaching their territory either as prey or a menace to their evaporating resources. 
Scattered across Iran and the Indian subcontinent, gandos are broad-snouted crocodiles, classed as ""vulnerable"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Iran has an estimated 400, comprising nearly 5% of the species. Iran's Department of Environment says it is doing its utmost to strike a balance between preserving the gandos and protecting local people. 
Despite all the thirst-driven tragedies in recent years, there is little sign of the pledge being put into effect. Traveling alongside River Bahu-Kalat, the gandos' main habitat in Iran, there are hardly any signposts warning about the danger. 
In the absence of a calibrated government strategy, volunteers have stepped in to try to save the species by quenching their thirst and satiating their hunger. 
In Bahu-Kalat, a village named after the river, up the dirt road from Dombak, I sit down with Malek-Dinar, who has been living with gandos for years.
""I have killed my garden to bank water for these creatures,"" he says of his land once thriving with bananas, lemons and mangoes. 
The river in the vicinity is home to a number of those crocodiles he regularly feeds with chicken breasts, because ""the killer heat has left frogs and their typical prey scarce"". 
""Come on, come here,"" Malek-Dinar repeatedly summons the crocodiles, while asking me to keep a safe distance. In the blink of an eye, two show up, waiting to be fed their ration of chicken from the familiar white bucket. 
Iran's water scarcity is not unique to Baluchistan. Deadly protests erupted in the oil-rich south-western Khuzestan province in July. And in late November, riot police in the central city of Isfahan fired birdshot at protesters gathered in the dried-up bed of the River Zayandeh-Roud. 
With global warming already showing its ugly face in Iran, the implications for Baluchistan could be catastrophic when coupled with decades of water mismanagement. 
After pulling over in Shir-Mohammad Bazar to shelter from a dust storm I meet women doing laundry in the open. 
""There is piping infrastructure but no running water,"" 35-year-old Malek-Naz tells me. Her husband, Osman, smirks at my question about showers, pointing to the sight of a woman bathing her son in a vessel of salty water next door. 
Osman, a father of five, and his cousin, Noushervan, who joins the conversation, make a living transporting petrol to neighbouring Pakistan, where it can be sold for more than at home. 
""There are numerous risks,"" Noushervan admits, albeit in a defiant tone. ""But let it be when there is no job."" And the risk has been real. In February, Iran's border guards opened fire on a group of ""fuel smugglers"", killing at least 10. 
Such crackdowns are commonplace in the sensitive border area, where successive Iranian administrations have worried about security. 
""They are wilfully turning a blind eye to our anguish. Trust me, we are no enemy of the state,"" Osman says, complaining of what he and many disillusioned Baluchis describe as ""systematic neglect"" of the community. 
Still, to him and a countless more Baluchis, unemployment is far less of a challenge than the water shortages that have turned even gandos - the ""blissful"" creatures with whom they once peacefully coexisted - against them. 
""We don't expect any government handout. We don't expect them to put jobs on a platter for us,"" says Noushervan. ""We Baluchis can survive on loaves of bread in a desert. But water is the essence of life. We won't survive without it, and who does?""

11,13,Climate change,Sarah Dickins,Climate change: Why do new homes not have solar panels?,2021-12-27,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-wales-59668836,"With energy bills soaring and the climate in crisis, you might ask why don't all new homes have solar panels to generate clean electricity for free?
Gas and electricity bills have risen by about Â£400 a year on average and Ofgem, the UK's energy regulator, has warned costs will spike further next year.
Ministers in Wales plan to force house builders to cut the carbon footprint of new homes by more than a third in 2022.
But developers want more government help to meet new building standards.
Families are bracing themselves to pay more for their energy as industry experts predict those that were paying Â£850 on average last year will see their bills rise to more than Â£1700.
The energy price cap, which limits how much providers can charge for energy per unit, will rise in the spring because of the ""unprecedented"" rise in gas prices that has seen some energy companies go bust.
""In December 2020 the average energy bill was Â£850,"" said Stephen Murray, from price comparison website Moneysupermarket.
""By April next year, if you're on a standard tariff, it will be around Â£1750 - that's over double where it was.""
There are up to 25 million UK homes with gas boilers but they are being phased out - with none being sold after 2035 - as gas heating accounts for 21% of the UK's carbon emissions.
Moneysupermarket has warned families could face ""expected increases of Â£450 to Â£500 at a one-off stroke"" because of the crisis, caused by more demand and less supply.
There are plans to help subsidise low-carbon heat pumps in place of gas boilers in some homes in Wales and England from April 2022 but with the country in the midst of an energy crisis, should solar panels be a new standard on all new homes?
For a medium-sized house, one established installer estimates a good 4kW solar panel system from a well-respected brand would cost about Â£6,000 to Â£7,000 to install.
Gareth Jones says his company, Carbon Zero Renewables, experienced a 1000% surge in orders for solar roof panels since the start of the energy crisis, with weekly enquiries surging from ""one or two to 25 to 30"".
""The reasons people are considering solar panels has changed from wanting to make money, to doing it to help the climate crisis,"" said Mr Jones, who is based in St Asaph, Denbighshire.
""You're not going to make much putting electricity back into the grid, but the environmental aspect is now a big driver - coupled with not getting impacted by soaring energy costs.
""And with gas being phased out, turning your home into its own electric creation station is proving attractive to some people. Plus if you have an electric car to charge too, customers like the fact all the energy they use is clean.
""Good systems aren't cheap but with energy costs rising, people think they can make their money back quicker than before - and good panels have a long lifespan.""
But while having a panel on your roof might work for many households, Mr Jones is quick to stress that while families should consider seeing if the sun would be a viable and cost-effective option to power and heat your home, it won't work for everyone.
""If your house is very shaded or possibly doesn't get the sun as much as most, then perhaps it might not work for you,"" he said.
""People need to consider amending their lifestyles too, so using electricity when the solar panels are creating energy when it's sunny. So instead of putting the dishwasher or washing machine on when it's dark, you do it in the day.
""The other things that need to be checked is if your roof is strong enough to support the panels and whether the location is appropriate - that's why it's advised to get a good and respected installer.""
So with an energy crisis and an estimated average of 7,400 new homes needed in Wales every year to keep up with housing demand, are governments considering dictating to builders new clean energy standards?
The Welsh government, for example, has declared a climate emergency and set steep targets to become net zero by 2050, so Wales' climate change minister is planning to tell developers that any new homes built from 2022 must cut emissions by 37%, compared to current standards.
But Julie James plans to leave it to the individual house builder on individual developments to decide how their homes will reduce their footprint - like solar panels or heat pumps - as Ms James accepts not all renewable energy sources work everywhere.
""We don't mandate a particular technology, we're mandating a particular outcome,"" she told the BBC.
One-sixth of Wales' carbon emissions come from heating and powering homes, yet new homes are still being built without clean energy consideration.
Ministers in Cardiff see renewable power as a way of helping people pay their bills and reducing fuel poverty - as well as moving towards net zero by 2050.
""This is a win-win situation for everyone really,"" said Ms James, the only minister in the UK whose brief is just climate change.
""This isn't just because I tend to like this kind of house, this is a climate emergency we are seeing... we see the extreme weather conditions people will have to cope with inside their houses. 
""We want the house to be able to withstand those increased weather pressures.""
The Welsh government is working with the construction industry to cut the carbon footprint on homes by at least 37% from next year - and to make sure as many of the supplies come from Wales to reduce any supply chain carbon footprint.
How will that extra cost affect you?
The organisation that represents small developers agrees climate change is the biggest threat, and that renewable energy built into new homes is the future.
This video can not be played
But the Federation of Master Builders (FMB) has warned the cost could be picked up by customers, which could affect first-time buyers the most.
""There are 70,000 households in Wales on housing waiting lists and we need more homes built,"" said Ifan Glyn, FMB Wales director.
""To enable that, small builders need extra support from Welsh government to help them meet any new housing standards.""
Some housing associations have already started fitting solar panels to new and existing homes after securing grants from the Welsh government - and they could provide a template for how to install panels to new homes cost-effectively that could be upscaled for major housing developments.
""Now when architects look at a brand new site, we think 'how easy is it to walk to?'"" said Elfed Roberts, of Pobl Housing's latest development at Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taf.
""Then we analyse where the sun is, where the great views are and where does the wind come from, that is a new way of working in new-home construction.""
