The rains have caused at least 18 deaths in Bahia since the beginning of November and thousands of people have been moved from some of the 67 towns facing further flooding.","['Sandstorm', 'A severe drought in South America is due in part to deforestation in the Amazon jungle.', 'Woman prepares Covid-19 vaccine', 'Archbishop Desmond Tutu', 'Desmond Tutu', 'South African woman wearing face mask', 'Demi Skipper holds a hairpin', 'One-minute World News summary', 'Fender the dog and its owner Susan', 'Painting of woman curled up with eyes closed', 'The ship that became famous for blocking the Suez Canal docks back in Felixstowe on time.', 'Chen Ting and her children']"
1,2,COP26,Matt McGrath,Climate change: Huge toll of extreme weather disasters in 2021,2021-12-27,http://www.bbc.com//news/science-environment-59761839,"Weather events, linked to a changing climate, brought misery to millions around the world in 2021 according to a new report. 
The study, from the charity Christian Aid, identified 10 extreme events that each caused more than $1.5bn of damage. 
The biggest financial impacts were from Hurricane Ida which hit the US in August and flooding in Europe in July. 
In many poorer regions, floods and storms caused mass displacements of people and severe suffering.
Not every extreme weather event is caused by or linked to climate change, although scientists have become bolder in exploring the connections. 
One leading researcher, Dr Friederike Otto, tweeted earlier this year that every heatwave happening in the world now is ""made more likely and more intense"" by human induced climate change.
In relation to storms and hurricanes, there is growing evidence that climate change is also affecting these events. 
In August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published the first part of its sixth assessment report.
In relation to hurricanes and tropical cyclones, the authors said they had ""high confidence"" that the evidence of human influence has strengthened. 
""The proportion of intense tropical cyclones, average peak tropical cyclone wind speeds, and peak wind speeds of the most intense tropical cyclones will increase on the global scale with increasing global warming,"" the study said. 
Just a few weeks after that report came out, Hurricane Ida hit the US. 
According to Christian Aid it was the most financially destructive weather event of the year.
The slow-moving hurricane saw thousands of residents in Louisiana evacuated out of its path. 
That storm brought massive rainfall across a number of states and cities, with New York issuing a flash-flood emergency alert for the first time.
Around 95 people died, with the economic losses estimated at $65bn. 
The second most financial costly event was the widespread flooding across Germany, France and other European countries in July.
The speed and intensity of the water overwhelmed defences and 240 people lost their lives. Reported damages were around $43bn.
In the study, the majority of the weather events in the list occurred in developed countries. 
That's because it is more feasible to estimate financial losses from insurance claims and these are usually available in richer countries, where people can afford to insure their homes and businesses. 
According to insurance company Aon, 2021 is likely to be the fourth time in five years that global natural catastrophes have cost more than $100bn. 
The report also documents many other events where the financial impact is harder to ascertain, but where the impact on people is significant. 
Flooding in South Sudan displaced over 800,000 people while 200,000 had to move to escape Cyclone Tauktae which hit India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives in May. 
""That's a huge human impact,"" said report author Dr Kat Kramer from Christian Aid.
""Obviously, losing your home, your livelihoods, and everything, and not having the resources to rebuild that is incredibly tough. Whereas at least if you have insurance, you have some mechanism for building that back.""
The report highlights the need for increased efforts on curbing emissions of carbon dioxide to reduce future weather related impacts. It is also calling on global climate diplomats to put their money where their mouth is and help poorer countries that suffer huge economic losses.
In the COP26 global climate talks in Glasgow, this issue of finance for loss and damage caused by climate-related events saw major disagreement between countries. Developing nations wanted cash - the richer ones said we need more talks on the question.
 ""Although it was good to see the issue of loss and damage become a major issue at COP26, it was bitterly disappointing to leave without a fund set up to actually help people who are suffering permanent losses from climate change,' said Nushrat Chowdhury, Christian Aid's climate justice adviser in Bangladesh.
""Bringing that fund to life needs to be a global priority in 2022.""

2,3,Climate change,Justin Rowlatt,Wildlife's winners and losers of 2021 - and how extreme weather set the tone,2021-12-27,http://www.bbc.com//news/science-environment-59757497,"Wildlife across the UK is increasingly suffering the impacts of extreme weather events and natural disasters, says the National Trust as it publishes its annual reckoning of UK wildlife ""winners and losers"".
The conservation charity also warns some of the landscapes it cares for are being altered forever as climate change makes some forms of extreme weather the new normal.
It points to the very dry spring that saw wildfires devastate parts of National Trust estates in the Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland and Marsden Moor in Yorkshire.  
The fires destroyed habitats for a range of threatened species including golden plover and Irish hare.
Meanwhile our warmer, wetter winters have accelerated the spread of diseases such as ash dieback, causing significant loss of trees, the charity says.  
This year's settled and warm autumn led to a spectacular show of colour but that was brought to an abrupt end when Storm Arwen ripped through the north of the country in November causing widespread destruction.
It uprooted thousands of trees on National Trust land in the Lake District and destroyed hundreds of irreplaceable trees and plants at its Bodnant Garden in Wales.
At Wallington in Northumberland, where gusts reached 98mph, more than half of the 250-year-old oak and beech trees were uprooted.   
""These extreme events are putting even more pressure on Britain's wildlife"", warns Ben McCarthy, head of nature conservation at the trust.  
He says more than half of UK species are already in decline and 15% of wildlife species are under threat of extinction.
""Isolated or small populations are the most at risk from climate impacts,"" he says, but not all species have suffered. Some animals and plants have actually flourished this year.
Here's a selection of the National Trust's run down of winners and losers on the 250,000 hectares of countryside, 780 miles of coastline and 500 historic properties, gardens and nature reserves it looks after:
The grey seal colonies cared for by the National Trust are expecting another increase in pup numbers thanks to a lack of predators and plentiful food. 
Orford Ness on the Suffolk coast recorded record numbers of seals. Normally one or two are seen at a time, but this year 200 were out on the beach together and stayed for several days.  
The dry May and exceptionally warm June helped unroll carpets of pyramidal orchids across Rodborough Common in Gloucestershire.  
Autumn lady's-tresses, the latest flowering UK orchid species, also had a very good year thanks to the cold wet May.  The plant's distinctive spires of white flowers appeared in the thousands at some grasslands and sand dunes in southern England and Wales. 
There was good news for the beavers released on the Holnicote Estate on Exmoor in January last year. Their first kit was born in June. 
It has also been a bumper year for grassland fungi with waxcaps doing especially well - evidence that some grasslands are thriving. In Shropshire, National Trust rangers were delighted to find 17 species of these fungi in one meadow. 
Meanwhile in Herefordshire, the team discovered an example striking non-native species - called Devil's Fingers or Octopus Stinkhorn - which was introduced to Europe accidentally from Australia or New Zealand around 1920.  
Butterflies have had a particularly bad year with the lowest numbers of the insects recorded in the Butterfly Conservation's Big Butterfly Count.  
National Trust teams reported butterflies emerging later due to the very cool spring, although the range of species remained stable. 
Oak trees in the south of England hardly produced any acorns this year, says the trust, in contrast to oaks further north which had a bumper crop. 
Oak flowers need dry warm weather to successfully produce acorns - conditions found in the north of England but not down south.  
The record number of late frosts through April - and into late May - in some parts of the country hammered apple blossom and led to a poor apple harvest, particularly in northern parts of England and Northern Ireland.  
It was a topsy-turvy year for terns too. 
At Blakeney Point in Norfolk, little terns - one species of these small seabirds - abandoned their nests, scared off by the presence of a short-eared owl and common gulls. But the neighbouring colonies of sandwich and common terns did well, the Trust says.

3,4,Climate change,BBC News,"Floods getting bigger and more frequent, says river expert",2021-12-26,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-59726441,"Floods on the River Severn and other waterways in the West Midlands are likely to continue getting bigger and more frequent, an expert has said.
Dave Throup retires this month after 21 years with the Environment Agency.
He said climate change was going to continue to have a significant impact on people living and working near the Severn, the UK's longest river.
Ahead of retirement, he reflected on his ""great"" job and becoming a familiar face in the media at times of flooding. 
Mr Throup, 56, began working for the agency on 1 January 2000 but said the floods of 2007 were his ""first taste of flooding on an almost apocalyptic scale"".
""We started seeing rivers do things we had never seen them do before and the penny really started to drop,"" he said.
""I remember being scared at the time, thinking 'This is not what normally happens'... there were people in the incident room saying 'This can't be right, it just doesn't happen' and some of these people had 30 or 40 years' experience seeing what rivers do.
""Since then, there have been five or six really big flood events and I've travelled all over [the] country, working in flood response in the Lake District, on the east coast and down south as well, and they all see a bit of it."" 
The largest floods ever recorded on the River Wye, which runs through Herefordshire, happened in 2020, he said.
Ahead of leaving his role, he said climate change would continue to have a huge impact on the size and scale of flooding in the West Midlands region. 
""We have had multiple big floods... and they are getting bigger and more frequent,"" Mr Throup said.
""I think the future is very uncertain but we also see very significant impacts from climate-related incidents.
""Flooding is one thing, as floods get bigger and more frequent, but that is only one part of story. I believe we are going to see significant water shortages as well in parts of our geography, 60 to 70% drops, which will not leave enough water for businesses and wildlife.
""These are really significant issues facing society and the speed with which they are happening [is] so scary, the stuff that has happened just in my lifetime has been incredible.""
As area manager for Herefordshire and Worcestershire, at times of flooding he is often called to manage incidents, working in the control room for weeks.
In the incident room, he said, people would work eight-hour shifts for five to six days, then have a rest day before continuing. 
""With the flooding you tend to get in this part of world, they are quite long lived. So if it is a big flood, you're working 24/7 for three or four weeks... it is full on,"" Mr Throup said. 
""It is quite a pressurised atmosphere in that room, when things happen you have got to react quick.
""Working with other professional partners like police and fire and rescue, it is a good vibe you get going and we do work together very well.""
When not working as an incident commander he is a media contact and said, during floods in 2014, he had once done 60 interviews in one day.
""The media world just descends with satellite trucks,"" he said.
""I spoke to everyone from Kerrang to Al Jazeera and some German TV company who couldn't understand a word I am saying, it was absolutely full on.""
The role also involves speaking with those affected by flooding, he said, which could be one of the hardest parts of the job. 
""You are taking some of the anger and the heat from it, but that is part of the role,"" he said.
""You are there in an Environment Agency jacket and people are flooded, they are understandably angry and upset, that is a difficult part of job, but it goes with the territory.""
He is also well known for his social media presence, at one time sparking his own fan club.
A self-confessed early-adopter of social media, he said he had found it a ""very powerful way to be able communicate with people with immediacy"".
""I've had fantastic messages since I announced my retirement,"" Mr Throup said, with more than 200 messages of people wishing him well and more than 1,000 likes. 
Mr Throup previously worked for Rentokil, as a planning officer in south Wales and for Severn Trent Water before moving to the Environment Agency.
Born and bred in Worcestershire, it has been ""nice to make a bit of a difference in the patch"", he said.
Married to Cathryn, with two grown-up children, Mr Throup said he hoped to spend the early part of his retirement travelling, if Covid-19 restrictions allowed.
""My wife is a teacher so we have never been able to travel much,"" he said.

5,6,Climate change,BBC News,Welsh cook will spend Christmas aboard Boaty McBoatface,2021-12-24,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-wales-59774341,"A Welsh chef will enjoy the ultimate white Christmas - on Boaty McBoatface's maiden voyage to Antarctica.
Steve Carpenter, 49, from Caerphilly, is a cook steward on the exploration ship, officially named RRS Sir David Attenborough.
He will serve Christmas dinner in the winter wonderland setting, but penguins, seals and polar bears are staying off the menu.
Steve said it would be ""traditional"" and served on Christmas Eve.
The Â£200m ship, part of the UK government's polar infrastructure investment programme, is due to return in May or June.
An online poll had suggested the ship be named Boaty McBoatface - but one of its robotic submarines has been given this moniker instead.
Making sure everyone gets a proper Christmas dinner is a big priority for the galley crew, as they celebrate the festive period on the other side of the world.
Being 8,500 miles from home has meant most of the dinner has been prepared in advance.
""We've got 10kg of Christmas pud for the crew to consume, 5kg of Christmas cake baked by our baker on board and iced and decorated and through the Christmas period we'll go through 500 mince pies,"" said Steve.
He added that because of the lack of availability of fresh fruit and vegetables on the voyage, they will use frozen sprouts - cooking about 300 for the meal, along with 20kg of roast potatoes and 34kg of stuffing for the 49 people on board.
""It's another working day for us in the galley, but hopefully we'll be able to sit down at the end of the meal and enjoy it with everyone,"" he said.
The RRS Sir David Attenborough is travelling from Rothera research station on Adelaide Island to Signey Island, where they are due to arrive on Christmas Day and where more scientists will disembark.
Working at sea for the past 25 years, Steve's had his fair share of far-flung Decembers, several times enjoying a curry Christmas dinner in the Middle East, during his time in the Royal Auxiliary Fleet.
But this year, he will have a guaranteed white Christmas in a place he says, ""doesn't compare to anywhere else"".
""This is my first trip down south. It's such an amazing opportunity to get down here. It's an absolutely mind-blowing place.""
Minister for the polar regions, Amanda Milling, said: ""This magnificent ship is something everyone across the United Kingdom can take immense pride in. I'd like to wish everyone on board for its maiden voyage a Merry Christmas.""

7,8,COP26,Martin Webber,Business Review of 2021: Climate change and Covid,2021-12-24,http://www.bbc.com//news/business-59730492,"Over the past year governments all over the world told businesses to radically step up their strategies for going green and shifting away from fossil fuels. 
The Glasgow COP 26 Climate Conference in November saw the host, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, setting out why humanity had to ""act now"".
Mr Johnson declared: ""If we don't get serious about climate change today, it will be too late for our children to do so tomorrow"".  
After the two weeks of talking in Glasgow, a draft deal pledging to ""phase out"" use of the dirtiest fuel, coal, was rejected by the biggest coal users, China and India.
But climate experts welcomed the fact that a reference to coal did stay in the final agreement, with a commitment instead to ""phase down"" coal use.  
Many established business leaders have already got the message and some have already completely changed what they do.  
The Australian mining entrepreneur, Andrew Forrest, the CEO of Fortescue Metals Group, told the BBC how his firm's large iron ore trucks and trains were being converted to so-called ""green hydrogen"".  
To make ""green hydrogen"", renewable energy - like wind power - is used to create electricity that then splits water into oxygen and hydrogen.  That hydrogen is captured to use as a fuel. In a hydrogen engine, the main emission is harmless water vapour.  
""This is the day the fossil fuel industry has denied would come. There are huge sources of green hydrogen - if the world bothers to make the transition. My own company is making the transition right now,"" he said.  
The entrepreneur said he took a four year PhD to study the environment and had learned that ""global warming is frighteningly real.""    
In April he took Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, to his vast mining operations that dig out iron ore to make the world's steel.  
Mr Forrest described how the prime minister faced ""big beefy Australian workers"" who would put an arm round Mr Morrison, saying ""come on ScoMo we're all going green, what's taking you so long? Green is the future mate"". 
A few months after that visit, Scott Morrison committed to making Australia ""net-zero"" by 2050 in line with the US, Japan, the EU and UK. 
""Net zero"" means that any climate damaging emissions are offset by emissions that are removed from the environment. 
China, Russia and Saudi Arabia are focussing on a 2060 ""net zero"" target. India's target is 2070. 
Meanwhile, in Denmark, green hydrogen is being created at a site at Brande in Jutland in the west of the country, using rows of dedicated wind turbines that tower over the countryside.  
The hydrogen is then used to fuel the vehicles of a nearby green taxi firm called DRIVR, which have chosen the hydrogen option over battery electric taxis. 
""In the taxi industry, the most important thing is time,"" Haydar Shaiwandi, chief executive of DRIVR told us. 
""We can't charge electric vehicles fast. The hydrogen vehicles actually act like regular diesel vehicles because for recharging a hydrogen vehicle is a maximum of five minutes.""  
But while change is happening, many say it is not happening fast enough.  
One big concern is that the green option is usually still the more expensive one, so most businesses still put their cash into cheaper but polluting investments. 
The fear is that without more decisive government action to change economic incentives, business and investors won't be able to deliver on the pledges set out by their nation's political leaders. 
Among those worried is Tariq Fancy, a former high flyer in the world of sustainable investing. He used to work as chief investment officer for sustainable investing at Blackrock, one of the world's largest asset managers.  
Mr Fancy says that - by law - managers like Blackrock need to maximise future retirement income for their investors. 
He argues that managers can look at environmental considerations but ""can't lose any money by investing in something that's good for the world"" because they are legally prohibited from doing that.
""Little to none of what any of the financial services industry is doing is actually - in any meaningful way - doing anything to fight climate change,"" he says. 
Because of this, he argues that the sector is therefore slower to enact reforms ""that experts are telling us we need to"".  
Mr Fancy concludes: ""All of this is what I call a deadly distraction."" 
The International Energy Agency, which is funded by governments of major western nations, made headlines in 2021 with a stark declaration. 
The IEA said that to meet governments' goal of limiting warming for the planet to an extra 1.5C, then there should be no development of any new fossil fuel fields. 
The IEA's chief energy economist Tim Gould says the world got closer to that scenario at Glasgow but ""we're not there yet"", he says. 
""In our view COP26 was all about setting ambitions. The acid test will be how quickly these are implemented. The time now is to really roll up the sleeves and put these pledges into practice."" 
For many years, Irwin Stelzer from the conservative US think-tank, the Hudson Institute, has supported a tax on carbon to encourage the private sector to invest more in green technology.
""Having waged this battle for a decade now and emerging bloody but unbowed, I would say a straight carbon tax will not pass,"" he tells me.    
But he is watching closely EU plans for a ""border tax"" on imported goods produced using ""dirty fuels"" - such as steel produced in China. 
""The EU may turn out to be one of the engines of progress, which is not its usual role. When they have border taxes, that tax imports for their carbon content, other nations will have to respond with similar taxes that will have the same effect."" 
The US will end up with its own border tax as well, Irwin Stelzer says: ""The politics is now falling in place to have some form of carbon pricing - directly or indirectly.""  
While policymakers were focussing on the long term in 2021, they also had a major job shoring up spending in the short term as the Covid pandemic hit activity for a second year. 
Most of the worst forecasts for the impact of Covid on jobs and incomes did not materialise.  Indeed most economies saw output return to levels seen before the pandemic. 
And by the end of 2021, there was growing concern about inflation set off by governments and consumers spending too much.  
Prices in the US are now 7% higher than a year ago - the fastest inflation rate since 1982.  
Ken Rogoff, former chief economist at the IMF, blames Covid-related supply chain issues in part, but says poor US government policy is also to blame.
""The stimulus - the American Rescue Plan - that the government put into place just after President Biden took office was just not well thought out or well designed.  It was throwing money at the economy - too much, too late,"" he says. 
""Frankly what they are doing now with infrastructure and social infrastructure would have done better to do back then."" 
For the big tech giants, it was another profitable year. Shares of the electric car firm, Tesla, rose 40%. Shares of Facebook (now known as Meta) were still up 20% despite a deluge of bad publicity after a former employee released internal documents.  
Frances Haugen said Facebook's own research had shown evidence of Instagram's harmful effects on some teenagers, and that the firm prioritised ""growth over safety"".  
Facebook said the leaks were misleading and said it had 40,000 people working on safety and security. 
Thanks to Covid, small business owners had a bleak time for much of 2021. But many of those that have survived now feel optimistic.  
The owner of the Aroma speciality coffee shop in Bologna in Italy, Cristina Caroli, was overcome with joy when tourists returned last summer.  
""It was literally a dream when we saw the first tourist after so long,"" she says. 
""Somebody speaking another language. It was very emotional. Americans! I couldn't believe it - then the English, the Swiss, the Germans - it was incredible it was fantastic!"" 
Cristina's enthusiasm for the future of her cafÃ© remains undimmed, telling me: ""Activities are starting again, the situation looks really better, it's a kind of renaissance after this bad period.""

8,9,Climate change,Marco Silva,Climate change: Small army of volunteers keeping deniers off Wikipedia,2021-12-24,http://www.bbc.com//news/blogs-trending-59452614,"Wikipedia has for so long been plagued by climate change denial. But a group of dedicated volunteers around the world is working tirelessly to keep the deniers at bay.
David Tetta lives in northern California, in the kind of close-knit community where neighbours just wander into each other's homes - during our interview, he breaks off for a second to shoo one of them out of the room.
It was while chatting to his neighbours that David first thought of volunteering to edit Wikipedia. In 2019, around the time wildfires were raging across the state, climate change was coming up more and more often as a topic. 
""Many conversations seemed to evolve into people expressing their feelings of angst and fear about the environment,"" he says. 
""I was wondering, what kind of information are people getting?""
David was well-placed to study the subject, having worked for the US Environmental Protection Agency for more than 30 years. 
He looked at the most obvious starting point for climate change information, Wikipedia - and, as he diplomatically puts it, he found ""certain areas of it that could be improved"".
He started small by proposing edits and discussing them with other volunteers. But he soon found himself pouring hundreds of hours into Wikipedia editing. 
""You have to read through about 100 pages of scientific information to edit a sentence,"" he says. 
English Wikipedia alone gets more than nine billion page views a month, and the magnitude of that figure is not lost on David.
""It gives you a certain sense of responsibility for making sure you're getting it right.""
The point of Wikipedia is that anyone with an internet connection can edit it. But that also makes it vulnerable to manipulation, and those who deny the climate crisis know it.
They've been waging an editing war to get their views across, and subtlety is not always their forte.
On one occasion, someone added a sentence wrongly suggesting climate scientists worldwide are in the pocket of a secretive Communist organisation.
Another user peppered paragraphs with the word ""alleged"", wrongly suggesting that basic climate science is far less settled than you might think.
And, in a rather mischievous twist, one time the entire text of an article on climate change was turned into a hyperlink. Users clicking on any of it would immediately be taken to an article about hoaxes.
Those kinds of stunts don't last long, though.
""That might stay up for a few minutes or an hour or so,"" David says. ""But usually, one of the editors will spot it.""
David is part of a small but dedicated group of volunteers who have made it their mission to curate and protect articles about climate change on English Wikipedia. And they're not afraid to pick a fight.
""I'll send [the deniers] a note on their personal page on Wikipedia saying, 'This is vandalism, this could have consequences,'"" says David. ""Sometimes these people get kicked off Wikipedia.""
Wikipedia, which was launched in 2001, has grown into one of the world's most popular websites, and is published in more than 300 different languages.
English Wikipedia is the largest version - and, according to the editors interviewed for this piece, the one where you can find the most reliable coverage of climate change.
""We are lucky with a large editor base,"" says Dutch volunteer Femke Nijsse. 
She's come to be regarded as one of the most influential voices within the small community of Wikipedia editors specialising in climate change.
If you have ever visited the main Wikipedia article on climate change, chances are that you read some of Femke's words - she's the user who's contributed the most to that article by far.
""I'm quite proud of my work on Wikipedia,"" she says.
Femke is a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Exeter, studying the transition to green energy - so global warming is something she's been thinking about for a while.
She's been editing Wikipedia articles for seven years and in that time she's got to know what junk science looks like.
""Editors recognise all of the common climate denial myths, and most editors have a good feeling for misinformation red flags, including use of unreliable sources, of emotive words,"" she says.
""The most satisfying editing for me is the removal of misinformation."" 
Femke is clinical in her debunking of bad science, and a stickler for Wikipedia's rules.
In October, a user tried to add a sentence to the climate change article, wrongly suggesting that stopping the world from using fossil fuels would make no difference to global warming. Femke dismissed the edit, but not before explaining that such a statement would have to be backed by reliable sources.
Wikipedia doesn't have a policy vetoing climate change denial, but there are policies that insist you have to cite quality sources, which tends to weed unscientific content out. 
""Wikipedia is just an uncomfortable place to be if you want to promote a point of view that goes against science,"" says volunteer editor Su-Laine Brodsky, a technology writer by profession. ""It's much easier to be on social media, where you can say whatever you want, and not really be held to task for it.""
From her home in Canada, Su-Laine has been editing Wikipedia pages for 15 years. 
She started out by sharing medical information and moved on to writing about sea otters and killer whales. She only recently decided to focus on climate pages.
""I've always been interested in the environment and wildlife, and was kind of intimidated by the idea of working on climate change,"" she says. ""I thought of climate change as a very technical and very controversial topic.""
But one day she stumbled across an article on sustainable energy that was riddled with problems. ""It had a lot of self-promotion - companies promoting themselves, people who are doing some kind of research promoting their pet project.""
Su-Laine got stuck in and started getting rid of it. 
""Wikipedians are people who fix things,"" she says. ""You notice something that's wrong, and you just need to have enough confidence to say, 'I can make this suck a bit less.'""
Sometimes the errors are obvious. But it didn't take long for Su-Laine to realise some users were twisting the facts in subtler ways, especially in less-trafficked articles. 
""When you've got an article about a climate science denier, people will try to soften that by saying so-and-so is a 'climate policy analyst'. That's a way of making the person sound more credible,"" she says. 
According to Alex Stinson from the Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, climate misinformation ranges from neglect - science that's out of date - to a lack of balance, to active disinformation. 
He's confident the organisation has what it takes to deal with the problem. 
""All of the studies on vandalism and misinformation suggest that our natural immune system on the big language Wikipedias catches something like 97% of it rapidly,"" he says. 
As well as human editors, the organisation also uses computer bots to fight vandalism. High-profile articles, including some about climate, also benefit from additional layers of protection - some of them can only be edited by users with a certain amount of editing experience. 
But there will always be areas of the website that are harder to patrol. 
""There are over 6,300,000 articles on English Wikipedia,"" Alex says. ""Not all of those are under the same kind of universal scrutiny of the community.""
And bad information, even outright conspiracies theories, are more common on climate pages in languages other than English, according to a recent BBC investigation. 
For now, it is entirely down to volunteers to hold the fort.
""Wikipedia is uneven,"" says Su-Laine. ""You have to still take it with a grain of salt.""

It is based on four outcomes - productivity, environmental sustainability, improved resilience and an effectively functioning supply chain.  
The aim is to try to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from farming. 
Agriculture as a sector is the largest emitter in Northern Ireland.  
Among the proposals are a reduction in the age at which cattle would go to slaughter, a ""farming for nature"" package and a ""farming for carbon"" package. 
""Farming for Nature"" is expected to form a central plank of agricultural support, over time.  
Its main focus will be on improving biodiversity on farms, through measures like hedgerows, integration of trees within crops and livestock farming, and protected areas.  
The ""Farming for Carbon"" strand aims to reduce the carbon footprint of the agricultural industry through a number of proposals, including reducing the number of older cattle for slaughter, improved genetics, and feed additives.  
The agriculture minister said designing the policy was ""a unique opportunity"" to redefine agricultural policy.
Edwin Poots also said it was a chance to ""target support to meet local priorities and needs much more effectively"".
""As we build out this future portfolio, I want to ensure that farmers are supported and equipped with the right tools to continue producing high quality, nutritious food whilst importantly, also reducing their environmental impact,"" he added.
The consultation is open until 15 February 2022, with early findings to be published early in the year.

11,12,Climate change,Jesse Preyser,Miners experiment with hydrogen to power giant trucks,2021-12-21,http://www.bbc.com//news/business-59576867,"Mining trucks are monstrous machines that guzzle fuel at a scarcely believable rate.
Weighing 220 tonnes, they can get through 134 litres of diesel every hour. 
Little wonder then that mining companies are focusing their attention on these vehicles as the first step to reducing their carbon footprint.
Anglo American, in collaboration with several partners, is retrofitting a mining haul truck with hydrogen power technology.
A first of its kind, the monster mining vehicle is being piloted in Limpopo, South Africa, at the firm's Mogalakwena platinum mine. 
Due to be launched in early 2022, the truck will be hybrid, with a hydrogen fuel cell providing roughly half of the power and a battery pack the other half. 
Instead of having a tank of diesel that powers the motor, hydrogen enters the fuel cell and mixes with oxygen to create water in a chemical reaction catalysed by platinum, which generates the electricity needed to power the motors that drive the wheels.
It only emits water vapour and the company says it has the potential to reduce on-site diesel emissions by up to 80%.
By rolling out this technology across its global truck fleet, Anglo American says it will be ""taking the equivalent of half a million diesel cars off the road"". 
The trucks also harvest regenerative energy created when driving downhill and braking, which is stored in the battery and extends the range of the vehicle.
Anglo is developing the truck along with partners Engie, NPROXX, First Mode, Williams Advanced Engineering, Ballard, ABB, Nel and Plug Power.
However, reducing the carbon footprint of the mining industry is a formidable task.
The construction sector, which includes mining, accounted for 36% of global final energy use and 39% of energy-related CO2 emissions in 2017, according to Davide Sabbadin, senior policy officer for climate and circular economy at the European Environmental Bureau (EEB).
He says the sector will need to reduce its energy consumption by a third if it hopes to be compatible with the Paris Agreement.
Hydrogen-powered trucks are a good start but need closer inspection, says Diego Marin, associate policy officer for environmental justice at the EEB. 
""While electric-powered vehicles, generally speaking, are less damaging to the environment than internal combustion engines on a life cycle analysis, this does not mean that they are green,"" he says.
Mr Marin points out it all hinges on how the hydrogen is produced. Some hydrogen is created using fossil fuels, which of course means there are substantial emissions as a result.
Anglo American says it is pulling out all the stops in an attempt to attain carbon neutrality by 2040.
Its hydrogen-powered hauler uses green hydrogen, which is made by splitting water atoms into oxygen and hydrogen, through electrolysis.
Even that is treated with caution by the EEB. 
""We should refrain from presenting hydrogen as a technological solution to all problemsâ¦ all forms of hydrogen come at an environmental cost - water use, impacts on nature,"" says Mr Sabbadin. 
The EEB also points out that hydrogen power has a shorter storage life than other renewables and is substantially more expensive to produce.  
More technology of business:
Whether it be investment for the mining industry's green goals or hydrogen power as a broader power solution, the issue of cost is definitely a pertinent one in South Africa. 
Jarrad Wright, an energy consultant and principal engineer for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) explains. 
""Hydrogen for power production is still quite expensive and unlikely to compete for some time."" 
This is largely due to a lack of supporting infrastructure for the new forms of energy to be created, distributed or stored. 
But, Mr Wright adds that it is possible to migrate to hydrogen in specific applications. 
At the moment South Africa's hydrogen power infrastructure is still sparse.
But the government and private partners are exploring ways to transform the country's platinum belt into a ""hydrogen valley"", with a focus on producing green hydrogen.
Anglo American is one of the private partners in this hydrogen infrastructure plan, which aims to create a regional renewable energy ecosystem. 
The starting point for this ecosystem is due to be built at the Mogalakwena mine itself, through the construction of a hydrogen production and storage complex. It incorporates the largest electrolyser in Africa, a solar power field, and will generate approximately 140MW of green power. 
Initially, it will be to support the 24-hour operation of the new truck, but once operational, the aim is for numerous complexes such as this one, to serve as local and regional hubs for the emerging hydrogen economy.
""The ecosystem would not only help us reduce our... emissions, but would also provide the foundation for green hydrogen production, facilitating the roll-out of hydrogen-powered haul trucks across South Africa,"" Anglo says.

12,13,Budget 2021,BBC News,Welsh budget: Bumper funding rise for Welsh NHS amid backlog,2021-12-20,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-wales-politics-59720795,"NHS spending in Wales will jump next year to tackle record high waiting times created by Covid.
An extra Â£893m will be pumped in during 2022, as part of the Â£24.6bn Welsh government budget.
More cash has also been promised for councils, and Labour Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said the budget will help make Wales ""a fairer nation"".
Welsh Conservatives said the budget had been made possible after record funding from the UK government.
Shops and hospitality will get a 50% cut to business rates - a relief to some firms waiting to hear if there would be any help for the tax from April.
Plaid Cymru said the spending plans will deliver a ""stronger"" Wales, following the party's co-operation agreement with Welsh Labour ministers.
The Welsh government say that over three years it will provide Â£1.3bn in extra direct funding to the Welsh NHS.
Most of that - Â£893m - will arrive in the first financial year. That is a 10.7% increase on the current budget, or 7.8% when inflation is taken into account, with smaller increases in later years.
Numbers waiting for treatments hit record levels last August.
Budget documents say the government's ""highest priority is to address the backlog of treatments that have been delayed by the pandemic"".
Helen Whyley of the Royal College of Nurses said a significant portion has to be spent on NHS salaries, with 1,719 vacancies in Wales.
The union is currently in dispute with the Welsh government over pay.
""You can have all the money in the world for services,"" Ms Whyley said. ""But if you don't have the staff to care for patients, and to deliver that care safely, it won't buy you anything.""
Despite the rise in day-to-day spending, funding for health care facilities will fall from Â£377m to Â£279m next year.
The Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents health organisations, said its ""members are disappointed in the lack of investment in capital infrastructure to improve and redesign NHS estates and facilities"".
Cardiff University's Guto Ifan said the planned increase for NHS spending in Wales appears to be ""slightly below"" extra cash for Wales triggered because of NHS spending in England.
""There are huge uncertainties about the medium-term impact of the pandemic and these spending plans could well need to be revised upwards in later years.""
Council funding will increase by Â£384m to Â£5.1bn - 8.1% in nominal terms or 5.2% when inflation is taken into account.
Officials say this is the largest increase to the cash for local government - which is spent on social care and other services - since devolution began.
Mr Ifan said councils should be able to meet their spending needs next year ""with relatively low increases in council tax"".
The announcement follows a promise of more cash for Welsh public services from the Treasury, which provides the lion's share of the Welsh government's money.
Experts at Cardiff University say Â£2.9bn will be available to spend by 2024.
It also comes after an agreement between the Welsh government and Plaid Cymru which included free school meals over three years and expanding free childcare to two-year-olds.
Both were included in the budget, with Â£30m for early years and childcare, and Â£90m for free school meals over three years.
According to the Welsh government, businesses in retail, leisure and hospitality will receive 50% rates relief for 2022-23, matching similar plans announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak for England.
It will be less than the 100% discount many such firms receive now. The scheme will be capped at Â£110,000 per business.
With other relief schemes ministers say 85,000 properties will be supported, while a further Â£35m will be spent to freeze rates for 2022-23.
Despite the announcement, Michael Manghan and Rhian Davies, who run the Crown and Sceptre in Cadoxton, Neath, are still concerned for what 2022 will hold.
Ms Davies feared the rate bill they would now need to pay was a ""big chunk of money to find"".
She said she would have like to have seen more, but added: ""It's better than nothing.""
Mr Manghan said: ""The money we've lost over the last year - we're only just coming back to repay people.""
Sam Dabb, who runs Le Pub in Newport, was pleased to hear the news. ""It's one of the main costs of the business, it's absolutely massive.""
One businessman said the Welsh government definitely had to meet the 50% cut introduced in England, and warned next year could be tough.
The Vale Resort in Hensol, Vale of Glamorgan, is starting to recover after a difficult 21 months. 
Bookings have increased since Covid restrictions were lifted and the company has opened a distillery on site to expand the business. 
Its managing director, Stephen Leeke, said government support schemes such as furlough, business rate relief and the Economic Resilience Fund (ERF) had helped the company stay afloat. 
He said: ""There's certainly an argument to say that they might consider going further, because I think we are in for a bit of a roller coaster now in the next couple of months and I don't think there's any doubt the industry will need some support.""
The Welsh government said it would spend Â£1.8bn on investments in its climate change department over three years, which includes Â£1.6bn on housing.
Of that, Â£1bn will be spent on housing and Â£375m for building safety.
Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said the Welsh government was still operating in a ""difficult financial context with our budget nearly Â£3bn lower than if it had increased in line with the economy since 2010-11"".
""This budget will support the Wales of today and shape the Wales of tomorrow. It will support our public services to be stronger, put Wales further down the path to being a net zero nation, and create a fairer nation with equality at its heart,"" she said.
Welsh Conservative finance spokesman Peter Fox said: ""Today's budget has been made possible by the Conservative government delivering record funding for Wales.
""In that light, I welcome the much-needed business rates holiday to help firms recover from the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, along with an important uplift in funding for our local authorities who deliver so many key services in communities across Wales.""
Llyr Gruffydd, Plaid Cymru finance spokesperson, said: ""Thanks to Plaid Cymru, this budget will deliver an even fairer, even greener, even stronger Wales through ambitious policy pledges.
""From free school meals for all primary pupils to extending free childcare to all two-year olds and much more, the commitments secured by Plaid Cymru as part of the co-operation agreement with Welsh government will secure transformational support for some of our poorest households and will change people's lives for the better across Wales.""
There will be relief among the many thousands working in hospitality, retail and leisure across Wales.
The Welsh government has matched what is happening in England and business rates for those industries will be halved. Most of them will still struggle to pay that as the pandemic continues to play havoc with trade with fewer people out shopping.
With a new Welsh government department focused on climate change, it's hardly surprising that it's getting more money. What is interesting, and tells us about the departments priorities, is that of the Â£1.8bn for capital spending by the climate change minister almost all of it (Â£1.6bn) is to improve the quality and supply of housing.   
This budget is taking the long term view even though the immediate economic landscape is extremely fragile.

13,14,Climate change,BBC News,Calls for 'reasoned debate' over oil and gas future,2021-12-19,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-59717784,"Business leaders have written a joint open letter to party leaders calling for a ""reasoned debate"" over the future of oil and gas in the UK.
The call comes after plans for the controversial Cambo Oil field off Shetland were put on hold. 
The letter says any statements calling for an end to new exploration have shaken investor confidence, placing tens of thousands of jobs at risk.
It warns politicians against creating a ""hostile investment environment"".
The letter, from Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce, supported by The British Chambers of Commerce and Scottish Chambers of Commerce, has also been signed by 58 leading figures from business and civic life in Aberdeen.
It says the economic wellbeing of whole communities across the UK is also being put at risk.
The letter adds that the statements calling for an end to new exploration ""threaten the very basis of a fair and inclusive transition at the most crucial point in our collective journey to a net-zero society"". 
""A transition, by definition, is a change of state over time,"" it says. ""This is one of the most complex challenges we have faced in our history and it doesn't lend itself to a simple, 'Who's good, who's bad? Who's green, who's not?' approach. To characterise it in this way is overly simplistic. 
""We must now pause and allow for a reasoned debate about our energy future to take place. At the same time, we urge politicians to reflect carefully on their public statements on oil and gas and the impact they have on investment in the industry.
""We must not create an adverse policy environment at this crucial moment in our energy transition journey.""
The letter adds that by 2050, the International Energy Agency projects that global oil and gas demand will fall by 80%, but 20 million barrels per day will still be needed. 
""Therefore, there is no current future scenario where there is not a requirement for some oil and gas,"" it says. ""Meantime, it continues to be required for people to travel, heat and power their homes and for the manufacture of many everyday goods."" 
""This leaves us with two options; to produce this domestically, with full control over the regulatory environment in which it is extracted; or to import an increasing amount of our energy, with the heavier carbon toll that shipping it from other parts of the world carries. The latter makes little economic sense, and even less environmental sense.""
Russell Borthwick, chief executive of Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: ""We have a shared interest in getting to net zero as quickly as possible, but over recent months our region has been portrayed as part of the problem rather than part of the solution.
""The reality is that the skills, people, and experience embedded in the north-east of Scotland have quietly been leading the way in moving the UK towards its net-zero targets, without any intervention from COP26. 
""However, turning the North Sea into a hostile investment environment today does nothing to support that transition. In fact, it does the opposite, driving investment and tens of thousands of jobs away to other regions of the world.""
He added that the energy-transition opportunity for Aberdeen could be bigger than the oil and gas industry - but to get there, strong leaders were needed who were willing to ""cut through the noise, see the big picture and get our transition steps in the right order to protect jobs, provide retraining opportunities and create new ones"".
Deirdre Michie, chief executive of OGUK, which represents the UK's offshore oil and gas industry, said: ""Right now, we need oil and gas for 73% of our total energy, and so the transition to carbon neutrality will be a huge and complex task.  
""We will only be able to achieve it with careful planning by policy-makers who think long-term to develop clear government policies that are then supported by all politicians working together in the national interest. ""
She said that for years to come, oil and gas needed to be part of the energy mix. 
""It will be far better for the nation and the environment if we source these fuels from around our shores rather than relying on even more imports,""  she added.
