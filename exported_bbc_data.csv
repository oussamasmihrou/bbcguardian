0,0,COP26,Louise Cullen,Climate change: Will 2022 be the year NI gets legislation?,2022-01-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-59742532,"Northern Ireland began 2021 without climate change legislation - and is ending the year with two bills in a race on the path to becoming law.  
Each have differing targets, with Climate Change Bill No. 1 proposing to reach Net Zero by 2045. 
The private member's bill from Green Party leader Clare Bailey is viewed as more ambitious than No. 2.
The second one, brought by the Agriculture and Environment Minister Edwin Poots, sets a target of an 82% reduction in emissions by 2050 - a figure aligned with what the Climate Change Committee says is possible given our reliance on agriculture. 
A short-lived bid to find a compromise between the two bills foundered in the autumn, and it remains to be seen which, if either, will cross the legislative finish line before this assembly's mandate ends in March.  
Farmers watched the goings-on at Stormont warily.
Some fear what any legislation will mean for herd numbers and methods of farming here. But amid the uncertainty, most acknowledge that the only thing they are sure of is that change is coming in 2022.  
Brexit posed problems for local fishermen, who said they'd been ""mugged"" during the share-out of the extra quotas. Organisations warned of a loss of millions of pounds to the economy for years to come. 
The Mournes began to recover slowly, after a huge gorse fire burned on Slieve Donard for three days in April.
It was the size of 365 rugby pitches, and devastated flora and fauna in the area of outstanding natural beauty, at a time of year when many birds and wildlife species were laying eggs and rearing young at ground level.
A plan to close the controversial Renewable Heat Incentive scheme and compensate owners was unveiled.
It proposed buying out participants at a total cost of around Â£68m - a prospect not welcomed by boiler owners. The consultation on closure and compensation closed in April and has yet to report back.
In November, the UK played host to the climate change conference, COP26.  
It saw a flurry of high-level agreements and side deals to tackle rising temperatures and their potentially catastrophic effects.  
There were agreements on the ""phase-down"" of coal, stopping and reversing deforestation, and increasing the use of electric vehicles. Taken far above our heads perhaps, but still relevant to Northern Ireland - for example, we are one of the most deforested parts of Europe, with just 8% of woodland cover.  
Schemes to redress that balance are already underway, with a new forest of native trees being planted in the hills above Belfast, and a One Million Trees programme putting saplings around the city. 
The largest ever outbreak of bird flu in the UK began in October. 
As cases spread in Great Britain, a protection zone was established in Northern Ireland.
Cases were identified in wild birds at the Waterworks in Belfast in November. The highly pathogenic disease was detected in three commercial flocks and a backyard flock in counties Tyrone and Antrim from November into December. 
Thousands of ducks and poultry have been culled. The minister said the compensation bill could run in to ""tens of millions"" of pounds.  
As the year drew to a close, a new energy strategy happened with a whimper rather than a bang, on one of the final pre-Christmas meeting days for the executive.  
It will be followed by an action plan early in the new year, officials said, with a ""significant"" pilot scheme to transform our home heating already planned.
This year will be another year of environmental focus. 
The proposals from COP26, if fully delivered on, only reduce global warming to just under 2C, which could still wipe some island nations and low-lying coastal areas off the map.  
Northern Ireland's contribution to reducing that impact has yet to be decided, but there will be a contribution, with changes and consequences for us all.

1,1,COP26,BBC News,EU plans to label gas and nuclear energy 'green' prompt row,2022-01-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59850093,"The European Commission has proposed plans to label some gas and nuclear power as green, prompting criticism from Germany. 
The proposal argues that gas and nuclear are key to helping transition to cleaner power. 
But Germany's environment minister called the plan ""absolutely wrong"".
It comes months after countries pledged to keep temperature rises within 1.5C at the COP26 climate summit. 
""It is necessary to recognise that the fossil gas and nuclear energy sectors can contribute to the decarbonisation of the Union's economy,"" the Commission's proposal says. 
Under the proposal, only gas and nuclear plants with the highest standards would be considered green. Nuclear plants would also have to have strict waste disposal plans, Deutsche Welle reports. While gas plants would have a limit of how much carbon dioxide is released per kilowatt-hour of energy produced. 
If a majority of EU members back the proposal then it will become law from 2023. 
France had reportedly pushed for nuclear power to be included. The country relies on nuclear energy for 70% of its electricity, although this will be cut to half over the next 15 years. 
France has also pledged to reduce its reliance on nuclear power by shutting down 12 nuclear reactors by 2035. 
The move has been criticised by Germany, which is in the process of phasing out nuclear completely and only has a few plants remaining.
German Environment Minister Steffi Lemke described the proposal as ""wrong"", adding that nuclear energy could lead to environmental disasters and large amounts of nuclear waste. 
Economy and Climate Protection Minister Robert Habeck called the plan ""greenwashing"", saying it ""waters down the good label for sustainability.""

2,2,COP26,BBC News,Denmark to make domestic flights fossil fuel free by 2030,2022-01-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59849898,"Denmark's government has announced a goal to make domestic flights fossil fuel free by 2030. 
In her New Year's address, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she wanted to ""make flying green"". 
However she acknowledged that the solutions to reach her target were not yet in place.
Denmark is aiming for a 70% cut in overall carbon emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.
""To travel is to live and therefore we fly,"" said Ms Frederiksen, announcing her plan.
""When other countries in the world are too slow, then Denmark must take the lead and raise the bar even more,"" she said. 
She added that achieving green domestic flights would be difficult but researchers and companies were working on solutions. 
The European manufacturer Airbus has announced plans to develop hydrogen-fuelled planes that could be operational by 2035. 
If the hydrogen used to fuel them is generated using renewable energy, this could be a way for Denmark to reach its goals. 
However it is unclear if the technology will be ready, and costs sufficiently low, for the 2030 target to be reached.
Sweden has also announced plans to make its domestic flights fossil fuel-free by 2030. It is also hoping to make international flights green by 2045. 
Earlier this year, the government there announced plans to introduce increased airport fees for high-polluting planes. 
Meanwhile France is moving to ban domestic flights where the same journey could be made by train in under two-and-a-half hours. 
The measures could affect travel between Paris and cities including Nantes, Lyon and Bordeaux.

5,5,Our Planet Now,Justin Rowlatt,California's fires threaten to ravage mighty sequoia forests,2022-01-01,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59842464,"California's giant sequoias are symbols of permanence - with some living for thousands of years. But the fierce wildfires ravaging the state threaten even these mighty trees, which are among the longest-lived organisms on Earth.
There is something primeval about giant sequoias. Their weird, broccoli-like branches wouldn't seem out of place with a long-necked dinosaur plodding by. 
And they are impossibly big: 30 or 40 people would have to link hands to hug the largest ones. The tallest trees are 90m (295ft) high. That's like a 30-storey tower block.
""They make you feel deep time"", sighs Christy Bingham, as she looks up at the biggest tree in the world - known as the General Sherman. 
""You can just sense standing here that this tree was born before Jesus."" 
Christy lowers her voice as she says this, as if out of respect. She's in charge of conserving these magnificent trees in the Sequoia National Park in the Sierra Nevada mountains - their last redoubt.
Sequoias live so long because they are exquisitely adapted to their environment, Christy tells me. 
There have always been fires in California and, in response, sequoias have developed insulating bark which can be up to a metre thick and which stops all but the hottest fires damaging the trees. 
But California's fires are changing. Christy leads me deeper into the forest, to show me what she means.
All you can hear is the sound of the wind in the leaves, the occasional cry of a raven and our footsteps crunching in the leaf litter. It is heaven. Until, that is, we walk over a ridge and the scene changes dramatically.
""This is what I wanted to show you, this was a giant sequoia grove"", she says. The landscape is monochrome now: grey or black, ash or cinders. Many of the huge trees have been reduced to columns of charcoal.
""Before 2015 no one saw a sequoia that looked like this,"" says Christy. She is crying now. ""You never saw a tree become a candle and burn up in this way before."" She points to the blackened remains of one of the biggest trees. 
""This 1,000- to 2,000-year-old tree should have lived another 500 to 800 years but it's gone."" 
Christy wipes her tears with the sleeve of her jacket. ""It will not sequester any more carbon. It will not be a spotted owl house. It's dead.""
It isn't just California's trees that have been suffering. Several hours' drive north we visit the Gold Rush-era town of Greenville. It used to be famous for its Wild West-style clapboard shops and its white painted church with its elegant wooden spire. 
All that is gone now, incinerated in the massive Dixie Fire this summer which burnt a million acres and cost some 600 million dollars to fight.
Nichoel Farris tells me how she got a text telling her to get out of town. An hour later the whole place - 1,500 buildings in total - had been erased, and her ""forever home"" with it.
""It took all the colour out of my life. Look, everything is just a shade of grey"", says Nichoel, gesturing towards the ashes of her house. ""We lost the future we'd planned for and built."" She's crying now. ""We lost our story"", she tells me.
But Nichoel hasn't lost all hope. She talks about how she wants to see the town rebuilt using the latest fire protection knowhow. She and her husband grew 80% of their food on their land and she hopes others will do the same. 
""Greenville could actually be a lighthouse community of sustainability and climate adaptation. And how we live in our new normal - because big fires are now the new normal,"" she says.
And, in the forest, Christy hasn't given up hope either. She expects to see baby sequoias sprouting here next year. They like burnt soil. And she says the forests need to be better managed, with dead wood and brush that can fuel fires cleared away.
What's more, a few of the trees, even here amongst the destruction, will survive. Christy starts to scrape with her fingers at the charred bark of a giant sequoia at the very edge of the grove. 
Not far in - about an inch or a couple of centimetres - and the charcoal gives way to reddish bark. ""This is just surface damage,"" she says. ""Look up at the leaves, lots of them have survived. This tree will live!""
The resilience of the sequoias should inspire us, says Christy: ""It is telling us we need to act on climate change now and that every little bit counts"". She turns to look me in the eye. 
""Every carbon reduction will help these forests persist,"" she says. And I notice her smile has returned as we walk on through the trees.

6,6,Climate change,BBC News,Colorado wildfires: Tens of thousands evacuated as blazes spread,2021-12-31,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59834897,"Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated and nearly 1,000 homes have been destroyed as wildfires spread through the US state of Colorado.
The fast-moving blazes are burning in Boulder County, north of Denver. Governor Jared Polis called it a ""New Year's Eve miracle"" that no deaths had been reported.
Some 30,000 people in the towns of Louisville and Superior were told to leave their homes on Thursday.
A state of emergency has been declared.
""It was in blink of an eye. This was a disaster in fast motion, all in the course of half a day,"" Governor Polis said in a news conference on Friday.
""Nearly 1,000 homes are gone,"" he added.
Winds of up to 105 mph (169 km/h) are fanning flames across the region amid a historic drought.
While previous fires in Colorado have been in rural areas, these latest blazes are burning in more suburban parts of the state. Thursday's fires, named the Marshall Fire and Middle Fork Fire, are coming relatively late in the season. 
At least some were sparked when power lines were toppled by strong winds, and they have quickly become the most destructive wildfires in the state's modern history. Experts say that wildfires in western North America have grown more intense in recent years. 
""This is our community so to watch it burn so quickly, so unexpectedly, is something that we are struggling to understand,"" said Gov Polis, who added that President Joe Biden had called to say he would sign a federal emergency declaration.
Some 370 homes went up in flames west of Superior and 210 were lost in the Old Town area of Superior, Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said.
A shopping complex and hotel were also destroyed, and about 6,000 acres were burned in total, the sheriff said. 
Snow had began falling near the fires on Friday morning, offering some reprieve to firefighters who say the remaining fires are expected to burn out shortly.
Neither of the two major hospitals in the area were affected, and all schools were ""spared"" from the flames, added Gov Polis. 
At least one first responder and six others were injured, Sheriff Pelle said, adding that more casualties were likely. 
One video taken outside a supermarket showed a dramatic scene as winds ripped through the car park.
Patrick Kilbride, 72, was at work in a hardware store when he heard the order to evacuate, The Denver Post reported. 
He rushed home but only had time to gather a few possessions before the flames engulfed the property. His pet dog and cat both died. 
""It's just a strange feeling to go from having everything to make your life comfortable to having nothing,"" he said.
Colorado has been experiencing extreme droughts in recent years. Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.
The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

7,7,Climate change,BBC News,Scotland's 100% renewables electricity target narrowly missed,2021-12-31,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-59837782,"Scotland narrowly missed a key environment target for the equivalent of 100% of electricity used in 2020 to be generated from renewable sources.
Official figures show gross consumption from renewables - minus net exports - was 98.6%
The full 2020 total was up from 97.4% in the early part of the year. 
It comes after the Scottish government missed a target for 11% of non-electrical heat to be generated by renewables in 2020.
Energy Secretary Michael Matheson said the country continued to ""lead the way"" with its commitment to be net zero by 2045.
In 2019, Scotland met 90.1% of its equivalent electricity consumption from renewables, according to Scottish government figures.
The 100% target was set in 2011, when renewable technologies generated just 37% of national demand.
Some of Scotland's electricity is sold overseas, meaning it also uses significant amounts of non-renewable electricity.
The latest full-year figures also showed:
Over the first nine months of 2021, provisional figures show generation was down 22.3% compared  with the same period in 2020.
The Scottish government said this was ""mainly due to continued mild weather over the year adversely affecting hydro and wind generation"".
According to the Energy Statistics for Scotland, electricity consumption also dropped by 5.7% from 2019 to 2020.
However, gas consumption rose slightly by 2.4% on 2019.
Scotland has some of the most ambitious climate targets in the world, with its Climate Change Bill setting out a legally-binding target of reaching net-zero emissions by 2045.
By 2030, ministers want renewable energy generation to account for 50% of energy demand across electricity, heat and transport.
Michael Matheson said he was ""proud of the progress Scotland has made over the past year"".
The energy secretary added: ""This statement shows we are continuing to make good progress with the equivalent of 98.6% of gross electricity consumption being from renewable sources in 2020, which is up from 89.8% in 2019.
""Whilst we do have many challenges ahead of us if we are going to meet our ambitious targets, we have laid the groundwork in 2021 for Scotland to take important leaps forward towards net zero.""

9,10,COP26,Martin Webber,Business Review of 2021: Climate change and Covid,2021-12-30,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59730492,"Over the past year governments all over the world told businesses to radically step up their strategies for going green and shifting away from fossil fuels. 
The Glasgow COP 26 Climate Conference in November saw the host, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, setting out why humanity had to ""act now"".
Mr Johnson declared: ""If we don't get serious about climate change today, it will be too late for our children to do so tomorrow"".  
After the two weeks of talking in Glasgow, a draft deal pledging to ""phase out"" use of the dirtiest fuel, coal, was rejected by the biggest coal users, China and India.
But climate experts welcomed the fact that a reference to coal did stay in the final agreement, with a commitment instead to ""phase down"" coal use.  
Many established business leaders have already got the message and some have already completely changed what they do.  
The Australian mining entrepreneur, Andrew Forrest, the CEO of Fortescue Metals Group, told the BBC how his firm's large iron ore trucks and trains were being converted to so-called ""green hydrogen"".  
To make ""green hydrogen"", renewable energy - like wind power - is used to create electricity that then splits water into oxygen and hydrogen.  That hydrogen is captured to use as a fuel. In a hydrogen engine, the main emission is harmless water vapour.  
""This is the day the fossil fuel industry has denied would come. There are huge sources of green hydrogen - if the world bothers to make the transition. My own company is making the transition right now,"" he said.  
The entrepreneur said he took a four year PhD to study the environment and had learned that ""global warming is frighteningly real.""    
In April he took Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, to his vast mining operations that dig out iron ore to make the world's steel.  
Mr Forrest described how the prime minister faced ""big beefy Australian workers"" who would put an arm round Mr Morrison, saying ""come on ScoMo we're all going green, what's taking you so long? Green is the future mate"". 
A few months after that visit, Scott Morrison committed to making Australia ""net-zero"" by 2050 in line with the US, Japan, the EU and UK. 
""Net zero"" means that any climate damaging emissions are offset by emissions that are removed from the environment. 
China, Russia and Saudi Arabia are focussing on a 2060 ""net zero"" target. India's target is 2070. 
Meanwhile, in Denmark, green hydrogen is being created at a site at Brande in Jutland in the west of the country, using rows of dedicated wind turbines that tower over the countryside.  
The hydrogen is then used to fuel the vehicles of a nearby green taxi firm called DRIVR, which have chosen the hydrogen option over battery electric taxis. 
""In the taxi industry, the most important thing is time,"" Haydar Shaiwandi, chief executive of DRIVR told us. 
""We can't charge electric vehicles fast. The hydrogen vehicles actually act like regular diesel vehicles because for recharging a hydrogen vehicle is a maximum of five minutes.""  
But while change is happening, many say it is not happening fast enough.  
One big concern is that the green option is usually still the more expensive one, so most businesses still put their cash into cheaper but polluting investments. 
The fear is that without more decisive government action to change economic incentives, business and investors won't be able to deliver on the pledges set out by their nation's political leaders. 
Among those worried is Tariq Fancy, a former high flyer in the world of sustainable investing. He used to work as chief investment officer for sustainable investing at Blackrock, one of the world's largest asset managers.  
Mr Fancy says that - by law - managers like Blackrock need to maximise future retirement income for their investors. 
He argues that managers can look at environmental considerations but ""can't lose any money by investing in something that's good for the world"" because they are legally prohibited from doing that.
""Little to none of what any of the financial services industry is doing is actually - in any meaningful way - doing anything to fight climate change,"" he says. 
Because of this, he argues that the sector is therefore slower to enact reforms ""that experts are telling us we need to"".  
Mr Fancy concludes: ""All of this is what I call a deadly distraction."" 
The International Energy Agency, which is funded by governments of major western nations, made headlines in 2021 with a stark declaration. 
The IEA said that to meet governments' goal of limiting warming for the planet to an extra 1.5C, then there should be no development of any new fossil fuel fields. 
The IEA's chief energy economist Tim Gould says the world got closer to that scenario at Glasgow but ""we're not there yet"", he says. 
""In our view COP26 was all about setting ambitions. The acid test will be how quickly these are implemented. The time now is to really roll up the sleeves and put these pledges into practice."" 
For many years, Irwin Stelzer from the conservative US think-tank, the Hudson Institute, has supported a tax on carbon to encourage the private sector to invest more in green technology.
""Having waged this battle for a decade now and emerging bloody but unbowed, I would say a straight carbon tax will not pass,"" he tells me.    
But he is watching closely EU plans for a ""border tax"" on imported goods produced using ""dirty fuels"" - such as steel produced in China. 
""The EU may turn out to be one of the engines of progress, which is not its usual role. When they have border taxes, that tax imports for their carbon content, other nations will have to respond with similar taxes that will have the same effect."" 
The US will end up with its own border tax as well, Irwin Stelzer says: ""The politics is now falling in place to have some form of carbon pricing - directly or indirectly.""  
While policymakers were focussing on the long term in 2021, they also had a major job shoring up spending in the short term as the Covid pandemic hit activity for a second year. 
Most of the worst forecasts for the impact of Covid on jobs and incomes did not materialise.  Indeed most economies saw output return to levels seen before the pandemic. 
And by the end of 2021, there was growing concern about inflation set off by governments and consumers spending too much.  
Prices in the US are now 7% higher than a year ago - the fastest inflation rate since 1982.  
Ken Rogoff, former chief economist at the IMF, blames Covid-related supply chain issues in part, but says poor US government policy is also to blame.
""The stimulus - the American Rescue Plan - that the government put into place just after President Biden took office was just not well thought out or well designed.  It was throwing money at the economy - too much, too late,"" he says. 
""Frankly what they are doing now with infrastructure and social infrastructure would have done better to do back then."" 
For the big tech giants, it was another profitable year. Shares of the electric car firm, Tesla, rose 40%. Shares of Facebook (now known as Meta) were still up 20% despite a deluge of bad publicity after a former employee released internal documents.  
Frances Haugen said Facebook's own research had shown evidence of Instagram's harmful effects on some teenagers, and that the firm prioritised ""growth over safety"".  
Facebook said the leaks were misleading and said it had 40,000 people working on safety and security. 
Thanks to Covid, small business owners had a bleak time for much of 2021. But many of those that have survived now feel optimistic.  
The owner of the Aroma speciality coffee shop in Bologna in Italy, Cristina Caroli, was overcome with joy when tourists returned last summer.  
""It was literally a dream when we saw the first tourist after so long,"" she says. 
""Somebody speaking another language. It was very emotional. Americans! I couldn't believe it - then the English, the Swiss, the Germans - it was incredible it was fantastic!"" 
Cristina's enthusiasm for the future of her cafÃ© remains undimmed, telling me: ""Activities are starting again, the situation looks really better, it's a kind of renaissance after this bad period.""

10,11,Climate change,Geeta Pandey,Why I switched to eating grandma's food,2021-12-30,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-59650408,"During my childhood visits to my ancestral home in rural Uttar Pradesh in northern India, I would often find my grandmother eating roti - flat bread - made with pearl millets or sorghum. 
She would mix the flour with water, take a chunk of the dough and beat it between her palms to make a big flat disc and then cook it on the wood-fired clay oven.
If she offered it to me, I'd turn my nose up. I couldn't comprehend why she'd choose them over thinner, tastier, easier-to-eat wheat rotis.
But a few years back, I switched to the food my grandma ate. 
I replaced wheat flour in my kitchen with flour made from pearl millets after I saw a report that said that the latter were healthier.
Even though my roti is now more chewy, I've stuck to it because it makes me feel healthier.
And I'm not alone - agriculture experts say in recent years, many ""forgotten foods"" are making a comeback in the farms and fields and also on our plates.
For a while now, there has been ""a concerted global effort"" to help millets shed their ""forgotten"" tag, says Dr Jacqueline Hughes, Director General of non-profit Icrisat (International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics).
India celebrated 2018 as Year of Millets and in March, the United Nations accepted Delhi's proposal to celebrate 2023 as the International Year of Millets.
Reports say the year would be used to raise awareness about the health benefits of millets and their suitability for cultivation - they can grow in degraded soil and need little pesticide - at a time when the world is confronted with the spectre of global warming.
Millets, Dr Hughes says, are increasingly being recognised as ""smart food"" because ""they are good for the planet, good for the farmer and good for you"".
""They require less water and grow in really hot temperatures. They are good for the farmer because they are very resilient and can survive pestilent diseases. They are good for you because they are more nutritious. Studies show that millets reduce diabetes, improve cholesterol profiles, alleviate calcium, zinc and iron deficiencies. They are also gluten free.""
Not surprising then that health experts in India are looking at millets with interest - the country is home to 80 million diabetics, over 17 million die from cardiovascular diseases every year and more than three million children are malnourished, half of them severely.  
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has talked of ""a millet revolution"" to ""stamp out malnutrition from the country"".
Experts say it's not an impossible task as millets were a staple for Indians for centuries.
Director of Indian Institute of Millet Research Vilas Tonapi says millets are ""the most ancient grains known to mankind"". 
""They were cultivated around 3000BC during the Indus Valley civilisation. Grown in 21 states, there are region and state specific millets which are part of the food culture and religious rituals.""
With the annual yield at 16 million tonnes, India remains the largest producer of millets in the world. But, in the past 50 years, Mr Tonapi says, the area under cultivation has shrunk from 38 million hectares to 13 million hectares and the share of millets in India's food basket has declined from 20% in the 1960s to 6% today.
The decline of millets began in 1969-70, Dr Tonapi says.
""Until then, India used to receive food aid and import large quantities of grains to feed its population. In a bid to attain food sufficiency and alleviate hunger, the government launched green revolution and introduced high-yielding varieties of rice and wheat.""
Between 1960 and 2015 in India, wheat production more than trebled, and rice production increased by 800% while millet production remained stagnant at low levels. 
Dr Hughes, who earlier this year was involved in the preparation of the Global Manifesto for Forgotten Foods, says ""this overemphasis on rice and wheat led to the neglect of millets and many traditional foods that fell by the wayside"". 
""Because they haven't been bred to modern tastes or are not easy to cook in today's fast-paced world, they have been under-utilised and neglected for decades. But it's terribly important to have diversity on your plate,"" she adds.
To do that, the ""forgotten"" crops will have to receive the same sort of attention given to rice and wheat and some of the other commercial crops. Experts say at least a beginning has been made where millets are concerned.
Several strategies suggested by agricultural scientists for their revival have begun to show results - Dr Tonapi says the demand for millets has grown by 146% in the past two years.
Millet cookies, chips, puffs and other munchies are being sold in supermarkets and online stores. The government is offering millets at one rupee a kg to millions through the public distribution system, and some state governments are serving ready-to-eat dishes as part of the school mid-day meal plan.
The renewed interest in coarse grains has come as a blessing for tribal communities in northern districts of Telangana state. 
P Aila is among a group of 10 tribal women in Asifabad who have been trained by Icrisat to prepare meals that are supplied to children in rural day-care centres.
Talking to me on the phone from her village, she lists the ingredients and spices that she uses in the meals and says that in August, they sold 12 tonnes of sweet and savoury dishes made with sorghum.  
Aila doesn't fully understand the interest in the humble grain that's been her staple all her life, but she tells me she's happy that it's going places.

13,14,COP26,Matt McGrath,Climate change: Hurricanes to expand into more populated regions,2021-12-29,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59775105,"Climate change will expand the range of tropical cyclones, making millions more people vulnerable to these devastating storms, a new study says.
At present, these cyclones - or hurricanes as they are also known - are mainly confined to the tropical regions north and south of the equator.
But researchers say that rising temperatures will allow these weather events to form in the mid-latitudes. 
This area includes cities such as New York, Beijing, Boston and Tokyo.
The study has been published in the journal Nature Geoscience.
The scientists involved say their work shows by the end of this century, cyclones will likely occur over a wider range than they have for three million years.
When subtropical storm Alpha made landfall in Portugal in September 2020, the relatively small scale of damage caused by the cyclone made few headlines.
But for scientists this was quite a momentous event.
""We hadn't observed this before,"" said Dr Joshua Studholme, a physicist from Yale University.
""You had a traditional kind of mid-latitude storm, that sort of decayed, and in its decay, the right conditions for a tropical cyclone to form occurred, and that hadn't happened to Portugal before.""
Dr Studholme is the lead author of this new study, which projects that a warming climate will see the formation of more of these types of storms in the mid-latitudes, where most of the world's population lives, and where most economic activity takes place.
He explained that as the world gets hotter, the difference in temperature between the equator and polar regions will decline, and this will impact the flow of the jet streams.
Normally, these high-altitude rivers of air act as a kind of border guard for hurricanes, keeping them closer to the equator.
""As the climate warms, that sort of jet stream activity that happens in the middle latitude, will weaken and in extreme cases split, allowing this sort of cyclone formation to occur.""
The question of the impact of human induced climate change on hurricanes has been contentious in the past, but recent research suggests that the connections are becoming clearer.
Last August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published the first part of its sixth assessment report, dealing with the science of a warming climate.
In relation to hurricanes and tropical cyclones, the authors said they had ""high confidence"" that the evidence of human influence has strengthened.
""The proportion of intense tropical cyclones, average peak tropical cyclone wind speeds, and peak wind speeds of the most intense tropical cyclones will increase on the global scale with increasing global warming,"" the IPCC said.
The new research published on Wednesday makes use of multiple strands of evidence to show that tropical cyclones in future are likely to occur over a wider range than previously thought.
""What we've done is make explicit the links between the physics going on within storms themselves and the dynamics of the atmosphere at the planetary scale,"" said Dr Studholme.
""This is a hard problem because this physics isn't well simulated in numerical models run on modern computers."" 
The likely expansion of these storms poses a significant danger to the world, especially when the other impacts of warming come into play.
""Tropical cyclones in the mid-latitude band could experience other changes such as slower motion and heavier rainfall,"" said Dr Gan Zhang, previously an atmospheric scientist at Princeton University and NOAA who wasn't involved in the new paper.
""These tropical cyclone changes, plus pronounced coastal sea level rise might compound potential societal impacts.""
Dr Zhang cautioned that the sensitivity of tropical cyclones to warming has a high level of uncertainty but he said the risk from these storms could still increase even with moderate levels of warming.
Certainly, the authors argue that this course is not set in stone and that dramatic reductions in carbon emissions over the next decade particularly, could alter the outcome.
""The control over this is the temperature gradient between the tropics and the poles, and that's very tightly linked to overall climate change,"" said Dr Studholme.
""By end of this century, the difference in that gradient between a high emission scenario and a low emission scenario is dramatic. That can be very significant in terms of how these hurricanes play out.""

14,15,Climate change,Jack Hunter,Alaska 'Icemageddon' warning follows heat record,2021-12-29,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59820999,"The coldest US state of Alaska has recorded its hottest-ever December day, amid an unusual winter warm spell.
Temperatures soared to a record 19.4C (67F) on the island of Kodiak on Sunday - almost seven degrees warmer than the state's previous high.
But elsewhere in Alaska temperatures have been plunging to record lows.
In the south-eastern town of Ketchikan, temperatures dropped to -18C (-0.4F) on 25 December - one of the town's coldest Christmas Days in the past century.
The weather extremes have prompted warnings of an ""Icemageddon"" from authorities, as torrents of rain and snow have left ice as hard as cement coating the roads.
Experts say warm air pouring in from Hawaii has made Alaska's air - usually cold and dry during December - more moist. This has meant heavy rain and snow storms are more likely in interior regions, away from the balmy coastal areas.
Heavy snowfall was followed by torrential rain that left the region coated with ice as the rain quickly froze, resulting in widespread power failures, road closures and offices being shut.
Thick ice formed on roads and made them treacherous for drivers, warned the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities.
""Ice is extremely difficult to remove once it has binded to the road surface. Even though air temps were warm... roads were at sub-zero temps, which caused ice to bind to the surface,"" the department said on Twitter.
The ice would likely cling to the roads until at least March or April, Climate Scientist Rick Thoman, of the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy, told the BBC.
The fiercest mid-winter storm since 1937 struck the central city of Fairbanks over Christmas, dumping more than 10in (25.4cm) of snow, Mr Thoman explained.
So much snow fell on Sunday it caved in the roof of the only grocery shop in the town of Delta Junction, 95 miles (153km) south-east of Fairbanks.
Mr Thoman said the blasts of extreme warm and cold temperatures over the past two decades were a sign of climate change.
""When all the pieces come together in a warming world we're going to get these unprecedented events, that's what we expect,"" he said.
The cold is set to return - temperatures in Fairbanks are forecast to drop to below -29C (-20F) this weekend. 
But warm, soggy episodes are likely to be more common in the future, Mr Thoman predicted.
""2021 really seems to be the year these extreme precipitation events have really come to the fore,"" he told the BBC.

15,16,Climate change,BBC News,Insulate Britain protests cost police more than Â£4m,2021-12-29,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-59808873,"Policing Insulate Britain's road-blocking protests over three months cost more than Â£4m, new figures have revealed.
The Met Police spent Â£4m on protests between 13 September and 20 November, according to figures released to the PA news agency under a Freedom of Information request.
Four other forces spent more than Â£300,000 combined.
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was ""appalled"" by the costs.
Insulate Britain wants the Government to insulate all UK homes by 2030 to cut carbon emissions.
It repeatedly blocked major roads between September and November, causing massive traffic disruption.
Activists also often glued their hands to the road or each other to make it harder to remove them.
The Met said 6,651 of the force's officers and staff were involved, at a cost of Â£3.1 million.
A further Â£600,000 was spent on deploying vehicles, while the overtime cost was Â£300,000, the force said.
Hertfordshire Police spent Â£185,000, Surrey Police Â£110,000, City of London Police Â£44,000 and Greater Manchester Police said it had spent Â£10,000 policing protests.
The total cost was likely to be much higher as these four forces only included overtime bills. 
For three months Insulate Britain frequently targeted the M25, the UK's busiest motorway, but also blocked roads in Manchester, Birmingham, London and the Port of Dover in Kent.
Mr Shapps said: ""I am appalled at the amount of time and public money that's been spent policing the selfish actions of Insulate Britain.
""Not only did their guerrilla tactics wreak havoc on our roads and inflict misery to thousands of motorists, but they diverted our emergency services away from vital work, costing the UK taxpayer millions in the process.""
Ken Marsh, chairman of the Met Police Federation which represents officers, described responding to the demonstrations on motorways as ""some of the most dangerous things my colleagues have had to do"".
National Highways applied for High Court injunctions to ban protests on motorways and major A roads in England after protestors repeatedly blocked junctions on the M25, some returning after being arrested and released from custody.
Ten Insulate Britain supporters have been jailed for breaching the injunctions so far, with prison sentences ranging from two to six months.
Mr Shapps is working to include new clauses in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill that creates tougher penalties for interfering with key infrastructure such as major roads. 
Insulate Britain spokeswoman Tracey Mallaghan said the group would ""much rather money was being spent on insulating homes and helping get people out of fuel poverty"".
She said they resorted to blocking roads after failing to get attention when they acted legally. 
""It seems the only way we can get air time is by annoying enough ordinary people,"" she said.
""Our government has proved time and time again they're not doing what is necessary for our children, for the future. So how can we stop?""

16,17,COP26,Matt McGrath,Climate change: Storm clouds gather after COP26,2021-12-29,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59744522,"Is the progress that was made at the COP26 Glasgow climate summit already in jeopardy because of challenges in the year ahead?
2021 was a momentous year for climate change. 
As well as a host of extreme, destructive events influenced by rising temperatures, the past 12 months have seen unprecedented political engagement on the issue, culminating in the COP26 summit in Glasgow in November.
Progress was undoubtedly made and the overall thrust of the meeting was towards more rapid action on a whole host of measures to curb emissions.
But there are now growing concerns that this momentum may dissipate over the coming months. 
The most grievous blow comes from the US.
The potential failure of President Biden to get his Build Back Better act through Congress would significantly impact the ability of the US to meet the tough climate targets that the White House has committed to.  
It would also hugely affect the relatively unified approach to climate change on display among world leaders at COP26.
""Everything that Biden pledged, led to this relatively good atmosphere and a sense of momentum in Glasgow,"" said Dr Joanna Depledge, a fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Environment, Energy and Natural Resource Governance. 
""But these were just promises, he needs to get the bill through Congress. And it's now looking increasingly dicey. He can do some things with executive orders, but that certainly isn't the kind of sustained institutional climate legislation change that we're really looking for."" 
""I think the situation to us, is critical.""
The despair among many in the US over the possible failure of President Biden's bill will also have knock-on effects throughout the world. This will certainly be the case in China, a country smarting from the perception that it flexed its political muscle in Glasgow to get its way. Biden's political difficulties with the bill are seen as more evidence that the ""West is declining"".
""I am worried 2022 will see a fuller display of geopolitical tension dominating the climate agenda,"" said Li Shuo, from Greenpeace East Asia. 
He is also concerned that the mooted introduction of carbon taxes on imported goods into Europe could elevate a sense of unfairness and frustration in Beijing.
""The Chinese side will see how they are treated vis-a-vis others and make its judgment on whether the game is fair, and most importantly, if it is about the environment at all, or just geopolitics and trade,"" he told BBC News. Overall, I am looking at a more turbulent year ahead. The years before the Paris agreement were an example of geopolitics helping the climate agenda forward. What lies ahead may be the opposite.""
This pessimistic outlook is echoed by the fact that next year's COP is being held in Egypt, and the one after that in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). 
""Neither of these countries could be described as climate leaders,"" said Prof J Timmons Roberts from Brown University in Rhode Island, US. The good side is that COP27 will be in a developing country, and some issues like loss and damage [who pays for the impact of climate change in the worst affected countries, and how it is paid] may get more traction, but on the issue of emissions reductions, it's not clear that they're going to be leaders.""
Another key concern heading into 2022 is that some countries may simply ignore aspects of the Glasgow climate pact that they don't like. 
One key measure in the deal was the request for all countries to ""revisit and strengthen"" their national climate pledges by the time delegates gather in Egypt late in 2022. 
Despite agreeing to this, a number of countries now say they simply won't update their plans, among them Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand's climate minister James Shaw told national media that this provision really only applied to large emitters like India, China, Russia and Brazil which hadn't significantly strengthened their plans in time for Glasgow.
However, there are also some positive developments in the offing that could make a significant difference to the general mood around climate change.
During COP26, the UK, EU, US, Germany and France agreed to pay $8.5bn to help South Africa abandon coal. Now, those close to the negotiations say that two new deals to help India and Indonesia move away from the most carbon-intensive energy source are in the pipeline.
These will be expensive, running into the tens of billions, but if they happen, they would represent a massive step away from fossil fuels. These types of arrangements, and the commitment to doubling adaptation finance made by richer countries will be key to progress in 2022, say officials. 
Another positive is that the UK's presidency continues right up to next November when Egypt takes over. 
COP26 President Alok Sharma has made it clear that he intends to push forward over the coming months in efforts to ensure that the agreements secured in Glasgow on deforestation, coal, finance and cars will start to be implemented. 
Mr Sharma's background as an auditor will come in handy in making sure there's no slippage over the integrity of the commitments made. 
""The UK, as hosts of COP26, spent the last two years working tirelessly with countries to build trust, which ultimately allowed us to deliver the Glasgow climate pact,"" he told BBC News. ""We will continue in the same vein through 2022 to make sure countries keep their promises, re-visit their emissions reductions targets, get finance flowing, and deliver on the many commitments made during the two weeks of the summit.""
Another positive is the fact that Germany will chair the G7 group of countries. The co-leader of the German Green party is now the country's foreign minister, so climate will remain high on the international diplomatic agenda. 
Infrastructure investment in the wake of the Covid pandemic, especially in middle income countries, also offers a great chance to lock in significant action to limit emissions. 
The final agreement on the rules for carbon markets, agreed in Glasgow, has coincided with a record rise in the price of carbon permits in Europe and the UK. 
While this has downsides, a sustained high carbon price could significantly speed up a transition to cleaner sources of energy.
But, as ever, global events could see all these potential positives quickly pale. 
Disputes between Russia and Ukraine, China's disengagement and a drubbing for the Democrats in mid-term elections in the US could all derail or at least delay any further progress on climate change. 
And stalling or taking small steps right now would be a disaster for efforts to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century.
""Right now, incremental steps are a death sentence,"" said Prof Roberts. 
However, the climate negotiations process is highly unpredictable - and even when things appear to be at their darkest, countries are often able to make sufficient compromises to keep things moving forward. 
Certainly the COP26 president says he's determined to push ahead and that the UK can be a role model for others.
""Leaving COP26 with the Glasgow climate pact was a historic moment demonstrating the world's shared commitment to taking real climate action,"" said Alok Sharma.
""As we look ahead, the most pressing issue is the timescale on when this action takes place and the reality is that the world needs to act at a much faster pace.""
""I believe we will reach a net zero world, and the UK is leading the way through our own actions such as rapidly expanding our renewables sector and working to eliminate the use of coal from our electricity generation in 2024, the question is whether that will be fast enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change.""

17,18,Climate change,BBC News,More young drivers choosing to learn on automatic cars,2021-12-28,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-59803133,"The number of young drivers choosing to take their tests in automatic cars has tripled since 2008 according to the DVSA.
Only 3.8% of tests were taken in an automatic back then, but now it's closer to 14%. 
President of the AA Edmund King says it's because young people want to drive electric cars, which are automatic.
They say they'll be introducing electric car driving lessons in 2022.
Lessons will focus on how to conserve battery and drive with one pedal, instead of learning clutch control and how to change gears. 
AA and the BSM driving schools successfully trialled electric car lessons last year and will now both give instructors the option of leasing an electric car. 
It could also mean changes to driving tests in the near future as a way of keeping up to date with changing car technology.
DVSA's Deputy Chief driving examiner Gordon Witherspoon told Auto Express magazine earlier this year ""we constantly review tests for all vehicle types"" and ""take account of changes in driving habits"". 
He said the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency had already started to look at how to include electric cars in learner assessments. 
Petrol and diesel cars won't be allowed to be sold in the UK after 2030, meaning electric car sales will increase.
The biggest barrier for young people is still the price of buying and insuring an electric car - the cheapest in the UK being just over Â£17,000 new. 
Tom Webster is a motoring journalist. He says although electric cars can save you money in the long run, they aren't affordable on a budget yet. 
Because they're relatively new, there isn't a big market for second-hand electric cars.
""The traditional small car that first time buyers are looking at, only a couple of them have recently started going electric"", he tells Newsbeat.
""They are expensive to buy brand new, and it's going to take time for them to come down in price to the extent that young drivers will be able to afford them.""
Once they have eventually gone through he ""depreciation process"", it might be more achievable for more young drivers to get hold of electric cars at an affordable price.
But, Tom says, the change over to electric cars is a very gradual process. 
He says petrol and diesel cars are not ""going away overnight"", and in the meantime it could be a little more challenging to use one, because charging points are more inaccessible than petrol stations.
""A lot of young people live in towns and cities, a lot of towns and cities don't have off street parking, so it's very hard to get your own charging point at home that you'll always be able to rely on.""
If you don't have a home charging point, Tom says finding a public charging point which works and is free can be ""challenging"".
A government grant of Â£1,500 is available if you want to buy a new electric car under Â£32,000. 
Edmund King  told The Telegraph that ""there is still a reluctance"" for young people to make that commitment for those reasons, but hopes that will change in the near future.

Just two days earlier, on a scorchingly hot August afternoon, the frail 70-year-old shepherd had gone to fetch water from a pond when he was pounced on by a gando, the local name for a mugger crocodile in Iran's Baluchistan region.  
""I didn't see it coming,"" he remembers of the traumatic event two years ago, with the shock and disbelief still vivid in his eyes.  
Siahouk was only able to escape once he ""managed to squeeze the plastic [water] bottle in between its jaws"", he says, reliving the moment as he rubs his bony face with his wrinkled left hand.  
The blood loss left Siahouk unconscious for half an hour. He was only found after his flock of sheep returned unaccompanied to his tiny village of Dombak.
Siahouk's account echoes that of many other victims, mostly children. More often than not, emotive headlines about Baluchi kids suffering grisly wounds inundate Iranian media, yet quickly disappear. 
In 2016, a nine-year-old called Alireza was swallowed by one such crocodile. And in July 2019, Hawa, 10, lost her right arm in an attack. Collecting water for laundry, she was almost dragged in by the crocodile before she was saved by her companions in a tug of war.  
The attacks have come at a time when Iran has been suffering acute water shortages and, consequentially, fast-shrinking natural habitats have seen the gandos' food supplies dry up. The starving animals treat humans approaching their territory either as prey or a menace to their evaporating resources. 
Scattered across Iran and the Indian subcontinent, gandos are broad-snouted crocodiles, classed as ""vulnerable"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Iran has an estimated 400, comprising nearly 5% of the species. Iran's Department of Environment says it is doing its utmost to strike a balance between preserving the gandos and protecting local people. 
Despite all the thirst-driven tragedies in recent years, there is little sign of the pledge being put into effect. Traveling alongside River Bahu-Kalat, the gandos' main habitat in Iran, there are hardly any signposts warning about the danger. 
In the absence of a calibrated government strategy, volunteers have stepped in to try to save the species by quenching their thirst and satiating their hunger. 
In Bahu-Kalat, a village named after the river, up the dirt road from Dombak, I sit down with Malek-Dinar, who has been living with gandos for years.
""I have killed my garden to bank water for these creatures,"" he says of his land once thriving with bananas, lemons and mangoes. 
The river in the vicinity is home to a number of those crocodiles he regularly feeds with chicken breasts, because ""the killer heat has left frogs and their typical prey scarce"". 
""Come on, come here,"" Malek-Dinar repeatedly summons the crocodiles, while asking me to keep a safe distance. In the blink of an eye, two show up, waiting to be fed their ration of chicken from the familiar white bucket. 
Iran's water scarcity is not unique to Baluchistan. Deadly protests erupted in the oil-rich south-western Khuzestan province in July. And in late November, riot police in the central city of Isfahan fired birdshot at protesters gathered in the dried-up bed of the River Zayandeh-Roud. 
With global warming already showing its ugly face in Iran, the implications for Baluchistan could be catastrophic when coupled with decades of water mismanagement. 
After pulling over in Shir-Mohammad Bazar to shelter from a dust storm I meet women doing laundry in the open. 
""There is piping infrastructure but no running water,"" 35-year-old Malek-Naz tells me. Her husband, Osman, smirks at my question about showers, pointing to the sight of a woman bathing her son in a vessel of salty water next door. 
Osman, a father of five, and his cousin, Noushervan, who joins the conversation, make a living transporting petrol to neighbouring Pakistan, where it can be sold for more than at home. 
""There are numerous risks,"" Noushervan admits, albeit in a defiant tone. ""But let it be when there is no job."" And the risk has been real. In February, Iran's border guards opened fire on a group of ""fuel smugglers"", killing at least 10. 
Such crackdowns are commonplace in the sensitive border area, where successive Iranian administrations have worried about security. 
""They are wilfully turning a blind eye to our anguish. Trust me, we are no enemy of the state,"" Osman says, complaining of what he and many disillusioned Baluchis describe as ""systematic neglect"" of the community. 
Still, to him and a countless more Baluchis, unemployment is far less of a challenge than the water shortages that have turned even gandos - the ""blissful"" creatures with whom they once peacefully coexisted - against them. 
""We don't expect any government handout. We don't expect them to put jobs on a platter for us,"" says Noushervan. ""We Baluchis can survive on loaves of bread in a desert. But water is the essence of life. We won't survive without it, and who does?""

19,20,Climate change,Sarah Dickins,Climate change: Why do new homes not have solar panels?,2021-12-27,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-59668836,"With energy bills soaring and the climate in crisis, you might ask why don't all new homes have solar panels to generate clean electricity for free?
Gas and electricity bills have risen by about Â£400 a year on average and Ofgem, the UK's energy regulator, has warned costs will spike further next year.
Ministers in Wales plan to force house builders to cut the carbon footprint of new homes by more than a third in 2022.
But developers want more government help to meet new building standards.
Families are bracing themselves to pay more for their energy as industry experts predict those that were paying Â£850 on average last year will see their bills rise to more than Â£1700.
The energy price cap, which limits how much providers can charge for energy per unit, will rise in the spring because of the ""unprecedented"" rise in gas prices that has seen some energy companies go bust.
""In December 2020 the average energy bill was Â£850,"" said Stephen Murray, from price comparison website Moneysupermarket.
""By April next year, if you're on a standard tariff, it will be around Â£1750 - that's over double where it was.""
There are up to 25 million UK homes with gas boilers but they are being phased out - with none being sold after 2035 - as gas heating accounts for 21% of the UK's carbon emissions.
Moneysupermarket has warned families could face ""expected increases of Â£450 to Â£500 at a one-off stroke"" because of the crisis, caused by more demand and less supply.
There are plans to help subsidise low-carbon heat pumps in place of gas boilers in some homes in Wales and England from April 2022 but with the country in the midst of an energy crisis, should solar panels be a new standard on all new homes?
For a medium-sized house, one established installer estimates a good 4kW solar panel system from a well-respected brand would cost about Â£6,000 to Â£7,000 to install.
Gareth Jones says his company, Carbon Zero Renewables, experienced a 1000% surge in orders for solar roof panels since the start of the energy crisis, with weekly enquiries surging from ""one or two to 25 to 30"".
""The reasons people are considering solar panels has changed from wanting to make money, to doing it to help the climate crisis,"" said Mr Jones, who is based in St Asaph, Denbighshire.
""You're not going to make much putting electricity back into the grid, but the environmental aspect is now a big driver - coupled with not getting impacted by soaring energy costs.
""And with gas being phased out, turning your home into its own electric creation station is proving attractive to some people. Plus if you have an electric car to charge too, customers like the fact all the energy they use is clean.
""Good systems aren't cheap but with energy costs rising, people think they can make their money back quicker than before - and good panels have a long lifespan.""
But while having a panel on your roof might work for many households, Mr Jones is quick to stress that while families should consider seeing if the sun would be a viable and cost-effective option to power and heat your home, it won't work for everyone.
""If your house is very shaded or possibly doesn't get the sun as much as most, then perhaps it might not work for you,"" he said.
""People need to consider amending their lifestyles too, so using electricity when the solar panels are creating energy when it's sunny. So instead of putting the dishwasher or washing machine on when it's dark, you do it in the day.
""The other things that need to be checked is if your roof is strong enough to support the panels and whether the location is appropriate - that's why it's advised to get a good and respected installer.""
So with an energy crisis and an estimated average of 7,400 new homes needed in Wales every year to keep up with housing demand, are governments considering dictating to builders new clean energy standards?
The Welsh government, for example, has declared a climate emergency and set steep targets to become net zero by 2050, so Wales' climate change minister is planning to tell developers that any new homes built from 2022 must cut emissions by 37%, compared to current standards.
But Julie James plans to leave it to the individual house builder on individual developments to decide how their homes will reduce their footprint - like solar panels or heat pumps - as Ms James accepts not all renewable energy sources work everywhere.
""We don't mandate a particular technology, we're mandating a particular outcome,"" she told the BBC.
One-sixth of Wales' carbon emissions come from heating and powering homes, yet new homes are still being built without clean energy consideration.
Ministers in Cardiff see renewable power as a way of helping people pay their bills and reducing fuel poverty - as well as moving towards net zero by 2050.
""This is a win-win situation for everyone really,"" said Ms James, the only minister in the UK whose brief is just climate change.
""This isn't just because I tend to like this kind of house, this is a climate emergency we are seeing... we see the extreme weather conditions people will have to cope with inside their houses. 
""We want the house to be able to withstand those increased weather pressures.""
The Welsh government is working with the construction industry to cut the carbon footprint on homes by at least 37% from next year - and to make sure as many of the supplies come from Wales to reduce any supply chain carbon footprint.
How will that extra cost affect you?
The organisation that represents small developers agrees climate change is the biggest threat, and that renewable energy built into new homes is the future.
This video can not be played
But the Federation of Master Builders (FMB) has warned the cost could be picked up by customers, which could affect first-time buyers the most.
""There are 70,000 households in Wales on housing waiting lists and we need more homes built,"" said Ifan Glyn, FMB Wales director.
""To enable that, small builders need extra support from Welsh government to help them meet any new housing standards.""
Some housing associations have already started fitting solar panels to new and existing homes after securing grants from the Welsh government - and they could provide a template for how to install panels to new homes cost-effectively that could be upscaled for major housing developments.
""Now when architects look at a brand new site, we think 'how easy is it to walk to?'"" said Elfed Roberts, of Pobl Housing's latest development at Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taf.
""Then we analyse where the sun is, where the great views are and where does the wind come from, that is a new way of working in new-home construction.""

21,22,COP26,Matt McGrath,Climate change: Huge toll of extreme weather disasters in 2021,2021-12-27,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59761839,"Weather events, linked to a changing climate, brought misery to millions around the world in 2021 according to a new report. 
The study, from the charity Christian Aid, identified 10 extreme events that each caused more than $1.5bn of damage. 
The biggest financial impacts were from Hurricane Ida which hit the US in August and flooding in Europe in July. 
In many poorer regions, floods and storms caused mass displacements of people and severe suffering.
Not every extreme weather event is caused by or linked to climate change, although scientists have become bolder in exploring the connections. 
One leading researcher, Dr Friederike Otto, tweeted earlier this year that every heatwave happening in the world now is ""made more likely and more intense"" by human induced climate change.
In relation to storms and hurricanes, there is growing evidence that climate change is also affecting these events. 
In August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published the first part of its sixth assessment report.
In relation to hurricanes and tropical cyclones, the authors said they had ""high confidence"" that the evidence of human influence has strengthened. 
""The proportion of intense tropical cyclones, average peak tropical cyclone wind speeds, and peak wind speeds of the most intense tropical cyclones will increase on the global scale with increasing global warming,"" the study said. 
Just a few weeks after that report came out, Hurricane Ida hit the US. 
According to Christian Aid it was the most financially destructive weather event of the year.
The slow-moving hurricane saw thousands of residents in Louisiana evacuated out of its path. 
That storm brought massive rainfall across a number of states and cities, with New York issuing a flash-flood emergency alert for the first time.
Around 95 people died, with the economic losses estimated at $65bn. 
The second most financial costly event was the widespread flooding across Germany, France and other European countries in July.
The speed and intensity of the water overwhelmed defences and 240 people lost their lives. Reported damages were around $43bn.
In the study, the majority of the weather events in the list occurred in developed countries. 
That's because it is more feasible to estimate financial losses from insurance claims and these are usually available in richer countries, where people can afford to insure their homes and businesses. 
According to insurance company Aon, 2021 is likely to be the fourth time in five years that global natural catastrophes have cost more than $100bn. 
The report also documents many other events where the financial impact is harder to ascertain, but where the impact on people is significant. 
Flooding in South Sudan displaced over 800,000 people while 200,000 had to move to escape Cyclone Tauktae which hit India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives in May. 
""That's a huge human impact,"" said report author Dr Kat Kramer from Christian Aid.
""Obviously, losing your home, your livelihoods, and everything, and not having the resources to rebuild that is incredibly tough. Whereas at least if you have insurance, you have some mechanism for building that back.""
The report highlights the need for increased efforts on curbing emissions of carbon dioxide to reduce future weather related impacts. It is also calling on global climate diplomats to put their money where their mouth is and help poorer countries that suffer huge economic losses.
In the COP26 global climate talks in Glasgow, this issue of finance for loss and damage caused by climate-related events saw major disagreement between countries. Developing nations wanted cash - the richer ones said we need more talks on the question.
 ""Although it was good to see the issue of loss and damage become a major issue at COP26, it was bitterly disappointing to leave without a fund set up to actually help people who are suffering permanent losses from climate change,' said Nushrat Chowdhury, Christian Aid's climate justice adviser in Bangladesh.
""Bringing that fund to life needs to be a global priority in 2022.""

22,23,Climate change,Justin Rowlatt,Wildlife's winners and losers of 2021 - and how extreme weather set the tone,2021-12-27,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59757497,"Wildlife across the UK is increasingly suffering the impacts of extreme weather events and natural disasters, says the National Trust as it publishes its annual reckoning of UK wildlife ""winners and losers"".
The conservation charity also warns some of the landscapes it cares for are being altered forever as climate change makes some forms of extreme weather the new normal.
It points to the very dry spring that saw wildfires devastate parts of National Trust estates in the Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland and Marsden Moor in Yorkshire.  
The fires destroyed habitats for a range of threatened species including golden plover and Irish hare.
Meanwhile our warmer, wetter winters have accelerated the spread of diseases such as ash dieback, causing significant loss of trees, the charity says.  
This year's settled and warm autumn led to a spectacular show of colour but that was brought to an abrupt end when Storm Arwen ripped through the north of the country in November causing widespread destruction.
It uprooted thousands of trees on National Trust land in the Lake District and destroyed hundreds of irreplaceable trees and plants at its Bodnant Garden in Wales.
At Wallington in Northumberland, where gusts reached 98mph, more than half of the 250-year-old oak and beech trees were uprooted.   
""These extreme events are putting even more pressure on Britain's wildlife"", warns Ben McCarthy, head of nature conservation at the trust.  
He says more than half of UK species are already in decline and 15% of wildlife species are under threat of extinction.
""Isolated or small populations are the most at risk from climate impacts,"" he says, but not all species have suffered. Some animals and plants have actually flourished this year.
Here's a selection of the National Trust's run down of winners and losers on the 250,000 hectares of countryside, 780 miles of coastline and 500 historic properties, gardens and nature reserves it looks after:
The grey seal colonies cared for by the National Trust are expecting another increase in pup numbers thanks to a lack of predators and plentiful food. 
Orford Ness on the Suffolk coast recorded record numbers of seals. Normally one or two are seen at a time, but this year 200 were out on the beach together and stayed for several days.  
The dry May and exceptionally warm June helped unroll carpets of pyramidal orchids across Rodborough Common in Gloucestershire.  
Autumn lady's-tresses, the latest flowering UK orchid species, also had a very good year thanks to the cold wet May.  The plant's distinctive spires of white flowers appeared in the thousands at some grasslands and sand dunes in southern England and Wales. 
There was good news for the beavers released on the Holnicote Estate on Exmoor in January last year. Their first kit was born in June. 
It has also been a bumper year for grassland fungi with waxcaps doing especially well - evidence that some grasslands are thriving. In Shropshire, National Trust rangers were delighted to find 17 species of these fungi in one meadow. 
Meanwhile in Herefordshire, the team discovered an example striking non-native species - called Devil's Fingers or Octopus Stinkhorn - which was introduced to Europe accidentally from Australia or New Zealand around 1920.  
Butterflies have had a particularly bad year with the lowest numbers of the insects recorded in the Butterfly Conservation's Big Butterfly Count.  
National Trust teams reported butterflies emerging later due to the very cool spring, although the range of species remained stable. 
Oak trees in the south of England hardly produced any acorns this year, says the trust, in contrast to oaks further north which had a bumper crop. 
Oak flowers need dry warm weather to successfully produce acorns - conditions found in the north of England but not down south.  
The record number of late frosts through April - and into late May - in some parts of the country hammered apple blossom and led to a poor apple harvest, particularly in northern parts of England and Northern Ireland.  
It was a topsy-turvy year for terns too. 
At Blakeney Point in Norfolk, little terns - one species of these small seabirds - abandoned their nests, scared off by the presence of a short-eared owl and common gulls. But the neighbouring colonies of sandwich and common terns did well, the Trust says.

23,24,Climate change,BBC News,"Floods getting bigger and more frequent, says river expert",2021-12-26,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-59726441,"Floods on the River Severn and other waterways in the West Midlands are likely to continue getting bigger and more frequent, an expert has said.
Dave Throup retires this month after 21 years with the Environment Agency.
He said climate change was going to continue to have a significant impact on people living and working near the Severn, the UK's longest river.
Ahead of retirement, he reflected on his ""great"" job and becoming a familiar face in the media at times of flooding. 
Mr Throup, 56, began working for the agency on 1 January 2000 but said the floods of 2007 were his ""first taste of flooding on an almost apocalyptic scale"".
""We started seeing rivers do things we had never seen them do before and the penny really started to drop,"" he said.
""I remember being scared at the time, thinking 'This is not what normally happens'... there were people in the incident room saying 'This can't be right, it just doesn't happen' and some of these people had 30 or 40 years' experience seeing what rivers do.
""Since then, there have been five or six really big flood events and I've travelled all over [the] country, working in flood response in the Lake District, on the east coast and down south as well, and they all see a bit of it."" 
The largest floods ever recorded on the River Wye, which runs through Herefordshire, happened in 2020, he said.
Ahead of leaving his role, he said climate change would continue to have a huge impact on the size and scale of flooding in the West Midlands region. 
""We have had multiple big floods... and they are getting bigger and more frequent,"" Mr Throup said.
""I think the future is very uncertain but we also see very significant impacts from climate-related incidents.
""Flooding is one thing, as floods get bigger and more frequent, but that is only one part of story. I believe we are going to see significant water shortages as well in parts of our geography, 60 to 70% drops, which will not leave enough water for businesses and wildlife.
""These are really significant issues facing society and the speed with which they are happening [is] so scary, the stuff that has happened just in my lifetime has been incredible.""
As area manager for Herefordshire and Worcestershire, at times of flooding he is often called to manage incidents, working in the control room for weeks.
In the incident room, he said, people would work eight-hour shifts for five to six days, then have a rest day before continuing. 
""With the flooding you tend to get in this part of world, they are quite long lived. So if it is a big flood, you're working 24/7 for three or four weeks... it is full on,"" Mr Throup said. 
""It is quite a pressurised atmosphere in that room, when things happen you have got to react quick.
""Working with other professional partners like police and fire and rescue, it is a good vibe you get going and we do work together very well.""
When not working as an incident commander he is a media contact and said, during floods in 2014, he had once done 60 interviews in one day.
""The media world just descends with satellite trucks,"" he said.
""I spoke to everyone from Kerrang to Al Jazeera and some German TV company who couldn't understand a word I am saying, it was absolutely full on.""
The role also involves speaking with those affected by flooding, he said, which could be one of the hardest parts of the job. 
""You are taking some of the anger and the heat from it, but that is part of the role,"" he said.
""You are there in an Environment Agency jacket and people are flooded, they are understandably angry and upset, that is a difficult part of job, but it goes with the territory.""
He is also well known for his social media presence, at one time sparking his own fan club.
A self-confessed early-adopter of social media, he said he had found it a ""very powerful way to be able communicate with people with immediacy"".
""I've had fantastic messages since I announced my retirement,"" Mr Throup said, with more than 200 messages of people wishing him well and more than 1,000 likes. 
Mr Throup previously worked for Rentokil, as a planning officer in south Wales and for Severn Trent Water before moving to the Environment Agency.
Born and bred in Worcestershire, it has been ""nice to make a bit of a difference in the patch"", he said.
Married to Cathryn, with two grown-up children, Mr Throup said he hoped to spend the early part of his retirement travelling, if Covid-19 restrictions allowed.
""My wife is a teacher so we have never been able to travel much,"" he said.

Steve Carpenter, 49, from Caerphilly, is a cook steward on the exploration ship, officially named RRS Sir David Attenborough.
He will serve Christmas dinner in the winter wonderland setting, but penguins, seals and polar bears are staying off the menu.
Steve said it would be ""traditional"" and served on Christmas Eve.
The Â£200m ship, part of the UK government's polar infrastructure investment programme, is due to return in May or June.
An online poll had suggested the ship be named Boaty McBoatface - but one of its robotic submarines has been given this moniker instead.
Making sure everyone gets a proper Christmas dinner is a big priority for the galley crew, as they celebrate the festive period on the other side of the world.
Being 8,500 miles from home has meant most of the dinner has been prepared in advance.
""We've got 10kg of Christmas pud for the crew to consume, 5kg of Christmas cake baked by our baker on board and iced and decorated and through the Christmas period we'll go through 500 mince pies,"" said Steve.
He added that because of the lack of availability of fresh fruit and vegetables on the voyage, they will use frozen sprouts - cooking about 300 for the meal, along with 20kg of roast potatoes and 34kg of stuffing for the 49 people on board.
""It's another working day for us in the galley, but hopefully we'll be able to sit down at the end of the meal and enjoy it with everyone,"" he said.
The RRS Sir David Attenborough is travelling from Rothera research station on Adelaide Island to Signey Island, where they are due to arrive on Christmas Day and where more scientists will disembark.
Working at sea for the past 25 years, Steve's had his fair share of far-flung Decembers, several times enjoying a curry Christmas dinner in the Middle East, during his time in the Royal Auxiliary Fleet.
But this year, he will have a guaranteed white Christmas in a place he says, ""doesn't compare to anywhere else"".
""This is my first trip down south. It's such an amazing opportunity to get down here. It's an absolutely mind-blowing place.""
Minister for the polar regions, Amanda Milling, said: ""This magnificent ship is something everyone across the United Kingdom can take immense pride in. I'd like to wish everyone on board for its maiden voyage a Merry Christmas.""

But a group of dedicated volunteers around the world is working tirelessly to keep the deniers at bay.
David Tetta lives in northern California, in the kind of close-knit community where neighbours just wander into each other's homes - during our interview, he breaks off for a second to shoo one of them out of the room.
It was while chatting to his neighbours that David first thought of volunteering to edit Wikipedia. In 2019, around the time wildfires were raging across the state, climate change was coming up more and more often as a topic. 
""Many conversations seemed to evolve into people expressing their feelings of angst and fear about the environment,"" he says. 
""I was wondering, what kind of information are people getting?""
David was well-placed to study the subject, having worked for the US Environmental Protection Agency for more than 30 years. 
He looked at the most obvious starting point for climate change information, Wikipedia - and, as he diplomatically puts it, he found ""certain areas of it that could be improved"".
He started small by proposing edits and discussing them with other volunteers. But he soon found himself pouring hundreds of hours into Wikipedia editing. 
""You have to read through about 100 pages of scientific information to edit a sentence,"" he says. 
English Wikipedia alone gets more than nine billion page views a month, and the magnitude of that figure is not lost on David.
""It gives you a certain sense of responsibility for making sure you're getting it right.""
The point of Wikipedia is that anyone with an internet connection can edit it. But that also makes it vulnerable to manipulation, and those who deny the climate crisis know it.
They've been waging an editing war to get their views across, and subtlety is not always their forte.
On one occasion, someone added a sentence wrongly suggesting climate scientists worldwide are in the pocket of a secretive Communist organisation.
Another user peppered paragraphs with the word ""alleged"", wrongly suggesting that basic climate science is far less settled than you might think.
And, in a rather mischievous twist, one time the entire text of an article on climate change was turned into a hyperlink. Users clicking on any of it would immediately be taken to an article about hoaxes.
Those kinds of stunts don't last long, though.
""That might stay up for a few minutes or an hour or so,"" David says. ""But usually, one of the editors will spot it.""
David is part of a small but dedicated group of volunteers who have made it their mission to curate and protect articles about climate change on English Wikipedia. And they're not afraid to pick a fight.
""I'll send [the deniers] a note on their personal page on Wikipedia saying, 'This is vandalism, this could have consequences,'"" says David. ""Sometimes these people get kicked off Wikipedia.""
Wikipedia, which was launched in 2001, has grown into one of the world's most popular websites, and is published in more than 300 different languages.
English Wikipedia is the largest version - and, according to the editors interviewed for this piece, the one where you can find the most reliable coverage of climate change.
""We are lucky with a large editor base,"" says Dutch volunteer Femke Nijsse. 
She's come to be regarded as one of the most influential voices within the small community of Wikipedia editors specialising in climate change.
If you have ever visited the main Wikipedia article on climate change, chances are that you read some of Femke's words - she's the user who's contributed the most to that article by far.
""I'm quite proud of my work on Wikipedia,"" she says.
Femke is a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Exeter, studying the transition to green energy - so global warming is something she's been thinking about for a while.
She's been editing Wikipedia articles for seven years and in that time she's got to know what junk science looks like.
""Editors recognise all of the common climate denial myths, and most editors have a good feeling for misinformation red flags, including use of unreliable sources, of emotive words,"" she says.
""The most satisfying editing for me is the removal of misinformation."" 
Femke is clinical in her debunking of bad science, and a stickler for Wikipedia's rules.
In October, a user tried to add a sentence to the climate change article, wrongly suggesting that stopping the world from using fossil fuels would make no difference to global warming. Femke dismissed the edit, but not before explaining that such a statement would have to be backed by reliable sources.
Wikipedia doesn't have a policy vetoing climate change denial, but there are policies that insist you have to cite quality sources, which tends to weed unscientific content out. 
""Wikipedia is just an uncomfortable place to be if you want to promote a point of view that goes against science,"" says volunteer editor Su-Laine Brodsky, a technology writer by profession. ""It's much easier to be on social media, where you can say whatever you want, and not really be held to task for it.""
From her home in Canada, Su-Laine has been editing Wikipedia pages for 15 years. 
She started out by sharing medical information and moved on to writing about sea otters and killer whales. She only recently decided to focus on climate pages.
""I've always been interested in the environment and wildlife, and was kind of intimidated by the idea of working on climate change,"" she says. ""I thought of climate change as a very technical and very controversial topic.""
But one day she stumbled across an article on sustainable energy that was riddled with problems. ""It had a lot of self-promotion - companies promoting themselves, people who are doing some kind of research promoting their pet project.""
Su-Laine got stuck in and started getting rid of it. 
""Wikipedians are people who fix things,"" she says. ""You notice something that's wrong, and you just need to have enough confidence to say, 'I can make this suck a bit less.'""
Sometimes the errors are obvious. But it didn't take long for Su-Laine to realise some users were twisting the facts in subtler ways, especially in less-trafficked articles. 
""When you've got an article about a climate science denier, people will try to soften that by saying so-and-so is a 'climate policy analyst'. That's a way of making the person sound more credible,"" she says. 
According to Alex Stinson from the Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, climate misinformation ranges from neglect - science that's out of date - to a lack of balance, to active disinformation. 
He's confident the organisation has what it takes to deal with the problem. 
""All of the studies on vandalism and misinformation suggest that our natural immune system on the big language Wikipedias catches something like 97% of it rapidly,"" he says. 
As well as human editors, the organisation also uses computer bots to fight vandalism. High-profile articles, including some about climate, also benefit from additional layers of protection - some of them can only be edited by users with a certain amount of editing experience. 
But there will always be areas of the website that are harder to patrol. 
""There are over 6,300,000 articles on English Wikipedia,"" Alex says. ""Not all of those are under the same kind of universal scrutiny of the community.""
And bad information, even outright conspiracies theories, are more common on climate pages in languages other than English, according to a recent BBC investigation. 
For now, it is entirely down to volunteers to hold the fort.
""Wikipedia is uneven,"" says Su-Laine. ""You have to still take it with a grain of salt.""

It is based on four outcomes - productivity, environmental sustainability, improved resilience and an effectively functioning supply chain.  
The aim is to try to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from farming. 
Agriculture as a sector is the largest emitter in Northern Ireland.  
Among the proposals are a reduction in the age at which cattle would go to slaughter, a ""farming for nature"" package and a ""farming for carbon"" package. 
""Farming for Nature"" is expected to form a central plank of agricultural support, over time.  
Its main focus will be on improving biodiversity on farms, through measures like hedgerows, integration of trees within crops and livestock farming, and protected areas.  
The ""Farming for Carbon"" strand aims to reduce the carbon footprint of the agricultural industry through a number of proposals, including reducing the number of older cattle for slaughter, improved genetics, and feed additives.  
The agriculture minister said designing the policy was ""a unique opportunity"" to redefine agricultural policy.
Edwin Poots also said it was a chance to ""target support to meet local priorities and needs much more effectively"".
""As we build out this future portfolio, I want to ensure that farmers are supported and equipped with the right tools to continue producing high quality, nutritious food whilst importantly, also reducing their environmental impact,"" he added.
The consultation is open until 15 February 2022, with early findings to be published early in the year.

30,31,Climate change,Jesse Preyser,Miners experiment with hydrogen to power giant trucks,2021-12-21,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59576867,"Mining trucks are monstrous machines that guzzle fuel at a scarcely believable rate.
Weighing 220 tonnes, they can get through 134 litres of diesel every hour. 
Little wonder then that mining companies are focusing their attention on these vehicles as the first step to reducing their carbon footprint.
Anglo American, in collaboration with several partners, is retrofitting a mining haul truck with hydrogen power technology.
A first of its kind, the monster mining vehicle is being piloted in Limpopo, South Africa, at the firm's Mogalakwena platinum mine. 
Due to be launched in early 2022, the truck will be hybrid, with a hydrogen fuel cell providing roughly half of the power and a battery pack the other half. 
Instead of having a tank of diesel that powers the motor, hydrogen enters the fuel cell and mixes with oxygen to create water in a chemical reaction catalysed by platinum, which generates the electricity needed to power the motors that drive the wheels.
It only emits water vapour and the company says it has the potential to reduce on-site diesel emissions by up to 80%.
By rolling out this technology across its global truck fleet, Anglo American says it will be ""taking the equivalent of half a million diesel cars off the road"". 
The trucks also harvest regenerative energy created when driving downhill and braking, which is stored in the battery and extends the range of the vehicle.
Anglo is developing the truck along with partners Engie, NPROXX, First Mode, Williams Advanced Engineering, Ballard, ABB, Nel and Plug Power.
However, reducing the carbon footprint of the mining industry is a formidable task.
The construction sector, which includes mining, accounted for 36% of global final energy use and 39% of energy-related CO2 emissions in 2017, according to Davide Sabbadin, senior policy officer for climate and circular economy at the European Environmental Bureau (EEB).
He says the sector will need to reduce its energy consumption by a third if it hopes to be compatible with the Paris Agreement.
Hydrogen-powered trucks are a good start but need closer inspection, says Diego Marin, associate policy officer for environmental justice at the EEB. 
""While electric-powered vehicles, generally speaking, are less damaging to the environment than internal combustion engines on a life cycle analysis, this does not mean that they are green,"" he says.
Mr Marin points out it all hinges on how the hydrogen is produced. Some hydrogen is created using fossil fuels, which of course means there are substantial emissions as a result.
Anglo American says it is pulling out all the stops in an attempt to attain carbon neutrality by 2040.
Its hydrogen-powered hauler uses green hydrogen, which is made by splitting water atoms into oxygen and hydrogen, through electrolysis.
Even that is treated with caution by the EEB. 
""We should refrain from presenting hydrogen as a technological solution to all problemsâ¦ all forms of hydrogen come at an environmental cost - water use, impacts on nature,"" says Mr Sabbadin. 
The EEB also points out that hydrogen power has a shorter storage life than other renewables and is substantially more expensive to produce.  
More technology of business:
Whether it be investment for the mining industry's green goals or hydrogen power as a broader power solution, the issue of cost is definitely a pertinent one in South Africa. 
Jarrad Wright, an energy consultant and principal engineer for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) explains. 
""Hydrogen for power production is still quite expensive and unlikely to compete for some time."" 
This is largely due to a lack of supporting infrastructure for the new forms of energy to be created, distributed or stored. 
But, Mr Wright adds that it is possible to migrate to hydrogen in specific applications. 
At the moment South Africa's hydrogen power infrastructure is still sparse.
But the government and private partners are exploring ways to transform the country's platinum belt into a ""hydrogen valley"", with a focus on producing green hydrogen.
Anglo American is one of the private partners in this hydrogen infrastructure plan, which aims to create a regional renewable energy ecosystem. 
The starting point for this ecosystem is due to be built at the Mogalakwena mine itself, through the construction of a hydrogen production and storage complex. It incorporates the largest electrolyser in Africa, a solar power field, and will generate approximately 140MW of green power. 
Initially, it will be to support the 24-hour operation of the new truck, but once operational, the aim is for numerous complexes such as this one, to serve as local and regional hubs for the emerging hydrogen economy.
""The ecosystem would not only help us reduce our... emissions, but would also provide the foundation for green hydrogen production, facilitating the roll-out of hydrogen-powered haul trucks across South Africa,"" Anglo says.

31,32,Budget 2021,BBC News,Welsh budget: Bumper funding rise for Welsh NHS amid backlog,2021-12-20,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-59720795,"NHS spending in Wales will jump next year to tackle record high waiting times created by Covid.
An extra Â£893m will be pumped in during 2022, as part of the Â£24.6bn Welsh government budget.
More cash has also been promised for councils, and Labour Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said the budget will help make Wales ""a fairer nation"".
Welsh Conservatives said the budget had been made possible after record funding from the UK government.
Shops and hospitality will get a 50% cut to business rates - a relief to some firms waiting to hear if there would be any help for the tax from April.
Plaid Cymru said the spending plans will deliver a ""stronger"" Wales, following the party's co-operation agreement with Welsh Labour ministers.
The Welsh government say that over three years it will provide Â£1.3bn in extra direct funding to the Welsh NHS.
Most of that - Â£893m - will arrive in the first financial year. That is a 10.7% increase on the current budget, or 7.8% when inflation is taken into account, with smaller increases in later years.
Numbers waiting for treatments hit record levels last August.
Budget documents say the government's ""highest priority is to address the backlog of treatments that have been delayed by the pandemic"".
Helen Whyley of the Royal College of Nurses said a significant portion has to be spent on NHS salaries, with 1,719 vacancies in Wales.
The union is currently in dispute with the Welsh government over pay.
""You can have all the money in the world for services,"" Ms Whyley said. ""But if you don't have the staff to care for patients, and to deliver that care safely, it won't buy you anything.""
Despite the rise in day-to-day spending, funding for health care facilities will fall from Â£377m to Â£279m next year.
The Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents health organisations, said its ""members are disappointed in the lack of investment in capital infrastructure to improve and redesign NHS estates and facilities"".
Cardiff University's Guto Ifan said the planned increase for NHS spending in Wales appears to be ""slightly below"" extra cash for Wales triggered because of NHS spending in England.
""There are huge uncertainties about the medium-term impact of the pandemic and these spending plans could well need to be revised upwards in later years.""
Council funding will increase by Â£384m to Â£5.1bn - 8.1% in nominal terms or 5.2% when inflation is taken into account.
Officials say this is the largest increase to the cash for local government - which is spent on social care and other services - since devolution began.
Mr Ifan said councils should be able to meet their spending needs next year ""with relatively low increases in council tax"".
The announcement follows a promise of more cash for Welsh public services from the Treasury, which provides the lion's share of the Welsh government's money.
Experts at Cardiff University say Â£2.9bn will be available to spend by 2024.
It also comes after an agreement between the Welsh government and Plaid Cymru which included free school meals over three years and expanding free childcare to two-year-olds.
Both were included in the budget, with Â£30m for early years and childcare, and Â£90m for free school meals over three years.
According to the Welsh government, businesses in retail, leisure and hospitality will receive 50% rates relief for 2022-23, matching similar plans announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak for England.
It will be less than the 100% discount many such firms receive now. The scheme will be capped at Â£110,000 per business.
With other relief schemes ministers say 85,000 properties will be supported, while a further Â£35m will be spent to freeze rates for 2022-23.
Despite the announcement, Michael Manghan and Rhian Davies, who run the Crown and Sceptre in Cadoxton, Neath, are still concerned for what 2022 will hold.
Ms Davies feared the rate bill they would now need to pay was a ""big chunk of money to find"".
She said she would have like to have seen more, but added: ""It's better than nothing.""
Mr Manghan said: ""The money we've lost over the last year - we're only just coming back to repay people.""
Sam Dabb, who runs Le Pub in Newport, was pleased to hear the news. ""It's one of the main costs of the business, it's absolutely massive.""
One businessman said the Welsh government definitely had to meet the 50% cut introduced in England, and warned next year could be tough.
The Vale Resort in Hensol, Vale of Glamorgan, is starting to recover after a difficult 21 months. 
Bookings have increased since Covid restrictions were lifted and the company has opened a distillery on site to expand the business. 
Its managing director, Stephen Leeke, said government support schemes such as furlough, business rate relief and the Economic Resilience Fund (ERF) had helped the company stay afloat. 
He said: ""There's certainly an argument to say that they might consider going further, because I think we are in for a bit of a roller coaster now in the next couple of months and I don't think there's any doubt the industry will need some support.""
The Welsh government said it would spend Â£1.8bn on investments in its climate change department over three years, which includes Â£1.6bn on housing.
Of that, Â£1bn will be spent on housing and Â£375m for building safety.
Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said the Welsh government was still operating in a ""difficult financial context with our budget nearly Â£3bn lower than if it had increased in line with the economy since 2010-11"".
""This budget will support the Wales of today and shape the Wales of tomorrow. It will support our public services to be stronger, put Wales further down the path to being a net zero nation, and create a fairer nation with equality at its heart,"" she said.
Welsh Conservative finance spokesman Peter Fox said: ""Today's budget has been made possible by the Conservative government delivering record funding for Wales.
""In that light, I welcome the much-needed business rates holiday to help firms recover from the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, along with an important uplift in funding for our local authorities who deliver so many key services in communities across Wales.""
Llyr Gruffydd, Plaid Cymru finance spokesperson, said: ""Thanks to Plaid Cymru, this budget will deliver an even fairer, even greener, even stronger Wales through ambitious policy pledges.
""From free school meals for all primary pupils to extending free childcare to all two-year olds and much more, the commitments secured by Plaid Cymru as part of the co-operation agreement with Welsh government will secure transformational support for some of our poorest households and will change people's lives for the better across Wales.""
There will be relief among the many thousands working in hospitality, retail and leisure across Wales.
The Welsh government has matched what is happening in England and business rates for those industries will be halved. Most of them will still struggle to pay that as the pandemic continues to play havoc with trade with fewer people out shopping.
With a new Welsh government department focused on climate change, it's hardly surprising that it's getting more money. What is interesting, and tells us about the departments priorities, is that of the Â£1.8bn for capital spending by the climate change minister almost all of it (Â£1.6bn) is to improve the quality and supply of housing.   
This budget is taking the long term view even though the immediate economic landscape is extremely fragile.

32,33,Climate change,BBC News,Calls for 'reasoned debate' over oil and gas future,2021-12-19,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-59717784,"Business leaders have written a joint open letter to party leaders calling for a ""reasoned debate"" over the future of oil and gas in the UK.
The call comes after plans for the controversial Cambo Oil field off Shetland were put on hold. 
The letter says any statements calling for an end to new exploration have shaken investor confidence, placing tens of thousands of jobs at risk.
It warns politicians against creating a ""hostile investment environment"".
The letter, from Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce, supported by The British Chambers of Commerce and Scottish Chambers of Commerce, has also been signed by 58 leading figures from business and civic life in Aberdeen.
It says the economic wellbeing of whole communities across the UK is also being put at risk.
The letter adds that the statements calling for an end to new exploration ""threaten the very basis of a fair and inclusive transition at the most crucial point in our collective journey to a net-zero society"". 
""A transition, by definition, is a change of state over time,"" it says. ""This is one of the most complex challenges we have faced in our history and it doesn't lend itself to a simple, 'Who's good, who's bad? Who's green, who's not?' approach. To characterise it in this way is overly simplistic. 
""We must now pause and allow for a reasoned debate about our energy future to take place. At the same time, we urge politicians to reflect carefully on their public statements on oil and gas and the impact they have on investment in the industry.
""We must not create an adverse policy environment at this crucial moment in our energy transition journey.""
The letter adds that by 2050, the International Energy Agency projects that global oil and gas demand will fall by 80%, but 20 million barrels per day will still be needed. 
""Therefore, there is no current future scenario where there is not a requirement for some oil and gas,"" it says. ""Meantime, it continues to be required for people to travel, heat and power their homes and for the manufacture of many everyday goods."" 
""This leaves us with two options; to produce this domestically, with full control over the regulatory environment in which it is extracted; or to import an increasing amount of our energy, with the heavier carbon toll that shipping it from other parts of the world carries. The latter makes little economic sense, and even less environmental sense.""
Russell Borthwick, chief executive of Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: ""We have a shared interest in getting to net zero as quickly as possible, but over recent months our region has been portrayed as part of the problem rather than part of the solution.
""The reality is that the skills, people, and experience embedded in the north-east of Scotland have quietly been leading the way in moving the UK towards its net-zero targets, without any intervention from COP26. 
""However, turning the North Sea into a hostile investment environment today does nothing to support that transition. In fact, it does the opposite, driving investment and tens of thousands of jobs away to other regions of the world.""
He added that the energy-transition opportunity for Aberdeen could be bigger than the oil and gas industry - but to get there, strong leaders were needed who were willing to ""cut through the noise, see the big picture and get our transition steps in the right order to protect jobs, provide retraining opportunities and create new ones"".
Deirdre Michie, chief executive of OGUK, which represents the UK's offshore oil and gas industry, said: ""Right now, we need oil and gas for 73% of our total energy, and so the transition to carbon neutrality will be a huge and complex task.  
""We will only be able to achieve it with careful planning by policy-makers who think long-term to develop clear government policies that are then supported by all politicians working together in the national interest. ""
She said that for years to come, oil and gas needed to be part of the energy mix. 
""It will be far better for the nation and the environment if we source these fuels from around our shores rather than relying on even more imports,""  she added.

Existing defences are ""in various states of disrepair"" at Hirael, in Bangor, a report submitted to Gwynedd Council has said.
The sea level is projected to rise 1.2m (3.9ft) by the end of this century, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. 
The area has previously been hit by severe flooding in 1923 and 1973.
Parts of Bangor have been identified as being at risk of flooding due to climate change.
The low-lying Hirael area faces a combination of factors, including an expected rise in sea levels and flooding the river Adda, as it empties into the sea. 
The plans at Beach Road showed the wall would be raised 1.3m (4ft 3in) above the existing level of the seafront promenade. Other plans include:
Designed by Ymgynghoriaeth Gwynedd Consultancy, the supporting documents said: ""The existing coastal defences at Hirael are limited with the only formal defences in the area being a sea wall which in various states of disrepair, a revetment and gabion baskets at the coastal frontage, north east of Beach Road. 
""Currently, there are no other structures that manage wave overtopping and inundation. 
""Temporary flood barriers such as sandbags have been deployed in the past along the length of the sea wall and two slipways to deal with high tides and wave surges but are not a sufficient source of long-term flood protection.""
It is expected that Gwynedd Council's planning department will consider the application in the coming months.

""At one point you could see your breath in the living room it was that cold,"" says Erin Davy. 
The 29-year-old was renting a two-bedroom flat in Melbourn, Cambridgeshire. 
The letting agent had given an estimate of around Â£80 a month for the electricity bill. But when she moved in, her direct debit ended up being just under Â£200 a month - and over winter her monthly bill soared to as much as Â£400 a month. 
""Privately renting now is so expensive for young people as it is. Just the rent, let alone having a massive energy bill on top of it,"" she says. ""It was crippling."" 
Erin's boyfriend had lost his job at the beginning of the pandemic so the couple were relying on her wage alone to pay the bills - and she had to increase her overdraft to cover it. 
The ballooning costs meant they had to be careful about when to turn the heating on and rarely used the living room because it was so difficult to heat. 
After asking their landlord to take action he replaced their old storage heaters with newer models - but it didn't help. The problem was the flat didn't seem to stay warm at all. 
As a converted outhouse, the building was badly insulated, especially the floors and walls. 
Poor insulation doesn't just mean higher bills for renters - it also has an impact on the environment. Heating buildings contributes to almost a quarter of all UK emissions and the more heat that escapes through walls and roofs, the more energy is wasted. 
For Erin, things got so bad that she asked for an inspection by the council's environmental health team who found the inadequate heating was a health and safety hazard. 
But the more she asked their landlord to make improvements, she says, the less responsive he became. Eventually the landlord served them with an eviction notice, saying he wanted the flat back for his own use. 
Erin says the experience of being evicted was ""horrible"" but they managed to find somewhere else to live. 
""We couldn't have stayed there - we couldn't afford it,"" she says. ""I couldn't have done another winter in a freezing cold house.""
If you think your energy bills are too high or your home isn't staying warm, the first thing to do is check its energy performance certificate (EPC) online, says Dan Wilson Craw, from campaign group Generation Rent. 
Buildings are graded between A - the most energy efficient - and G. In England and Wales, homes must have a rating of at least E to be rented out, with only limited exemptions. The government has also consulted on raising the minimum standard to band C. 
In Scotland, the government plans to require privately rented properties to have a rating of at least C from 2025. 
Damp or mould is another sign that your home may be poorly insulated. 
There is government advice available online on how to make your home more energy efficient, which Mr Craw advises renters look at before approaching their landlord. 
But if landlords refuse to take action you can ask the local council to carry out an inspection. Councils are responsible for enforcing health and safety standards of homes and if they find serious issues with damp or heating, they can force the landlord to make improvements. 
Mr Craw says there are also grants and funding available through some councils and energy companies to help make your home more energy efficient if you're on a low income. 
However, research by Generation Rent suggests many renters are reluctant to demand or invest in improvements because they are unsure whether they will live in a home long enough to benefit from the cheaper bills. 
Others may be worried that if their landlord does pay for improvements, they may increase the rent to recoup costs or even evict them. 
Mr Craw says government plans to abolish section 21 ""no fault"" evictions, which would prevent landlords evicting tenants without good reason, will help give renters more certainty about how long they will be living somewhere. 
Generation Rent also supports raising minimum energy efficiency standards for rented homes - and wants tenants to be able to claim back rent if landlords break the rules. 
And the group wants to limit the amount landlords can increase rent for existing tenants to wage inflation, to avoid them upping the rent if they are forced to pay for improvements. 
For landlords, the main barrier to making improvements is cost, according to Chris Norris, from the National Residential Landlords Association. 
Nearly one in five households in England live in the private rented sector, but this type of housing tends to be older and more difficult to insulate. 
The average cost of bringing a privately rented home up to EPC C standard is Â£7,646, according to the government. 
And while landlords must pay for any changes to their property, they generally don't see the benefits of lower bills. 
Mr Norris says the grants available are quite limited. 
The government recently announced grants of Â£5,000 would be available to people in England and Wales from next April to replace their gas boilers with low-carbon heat pumps, to help cut greenhouse gas emissions. 
But heat pumps can cost between Â£6,000 and Â£18,000 - not including any expensive new insulation that may also be needed - so the subsidy would not cover the total cost. 
As well as more generous grants, the association also wants to see tax deducted from spending on energy efficiency to give landlords an extra financial incentive. 
With gas prices surging, Mr Craw says making homes more energy efficient is even more urgent. 
""If you could address it, you can improve standards of life for private renters and cut carbon emissions,"" he says. ""But it requires action from the government to do that.""

36,37,Storm Dennis,Matthew Murray,Climate change: Young activists snub award,2021-12-17,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-59690009,"Young members of an environmental group have turned down an award from a council, accusing it of not doing enough to tackle climate change.
Pontypridd's Young Friends of the Earth has been campaigning for changes to address the climate emergency. 
It said Rhondda Cynon Taf council has not done enough since the devastating floods in 2020 after Storm Dennis. 
Group member Alice, 13, said: ""It would be hypocritical for us to take the award.""
""We feel Rhondda Cynon Taf council - and the world - isn't taking action against climate change,"" she added. 
""The major changes we could do as a county would be big decisions and not small day-to-day ones. 
""Because if you sit in a house which is on fire you wouldn't just sit there as the flames surrounded you and start making a plan how you're going to deal with the fire.
""You're going to act immediately and get water and you're going to put the fire out. You wouldn't sit there doing nothing. The world isn't in the best shape and they're not doing enough about it.""
Alice added that there was ""action immediately"" when the pandemic hit, and the same needed to be done for the climate change emergency.
""We need that with climate change because if we don't get it sorted out we might not be here.""
When Storm Dennis caused widespread flooding across south Wales in February 2020, Pontypridd was one of the worst affected towns. 
Homes and businesses were hit, with the middle of the town centre flooded after the River Taff burst its banks. 
""When we saw the town flood last year we knew climate change was getting worse and despite what people were saying about it getting better because it's not,"" said Alice. 
""I felt terrified when I saw water running down the main street because if water can reach that high because of a storm, imagine what it will be like in 10 years.""
Dan, 12, another member of Young Friends of the Earth, said: ""I would have expected Rhondda Cynon Taf council to declare a climate emergency after the Welsh government did. 
""They are one of the few councils in Wales not to declare it and after Storm Dennis I'd have thought it would have been the first thing they would have done. 
""I fear, with the melting ice caps, much of the Welsh coast and RCT will get completely flooded and we'll lose whole towns and people's homes. So we need to take action so we don't lose all the history too.""
Rowan, 10, said they thought it would generate more publicity to turn down the award than accept it.
""I don't think people understand how bad things are. I find it traumatising, when I think to the future.
""I might have a future with crumbling mountains and suffocating air, and I don't want that to happen.""
Council leader Andrew Morgan replied to a letter from the group declining the award, saying the council is committed to achieving net zero by 2030 and ""has already made progress towards achieving this commitment to meet and contribute to global, national and local targets"".

A cross-party task group has spent almost two years exploring what Preston City Council needs to do to fulfil the pledge made in April 2019.
The report said decisions would have to be taken ensure ""the greatest carbon reduction can be achieved at the earliest opportunity"".
But its fleet of 124 vehicles will remain diesel-driven.
Councillors voted for the authority to invest a further Â£4.8m over the next five years in replacing the vehicles, but an accompanying report said it was not currently possible to purchase ""alternative fuelled"" vehicles, because of the lack of the necessary infrastructure to operate them.
Environment and community safety cabinet member Robert Boswell defended the decision not to shift the fleet to electric at this point, warning that if the council had to charge all of its vehicles ""there might be power failures in Preston, because there [are] other factors [to consider]"".
He suggested that the authority faced the same practical barriers to electric vehicles that were experienced by some members of the public, including a lack of charging points.
""The new vehicles that we will be moving to, though not electronic vehicles, have a reduction in emissions and have potential [for] fuel savings and more efficient engines,"" he said.
Liberal Democrat group leader John Potter branded the report ""disappointing"" and said the council would not achieve its carbon-cutting aims.
However, the Labour chair of the task group, James Hull, said it demonstrated that the authority would have a ""robust climate change agenda"" at the forefront of all its work.
The main recommendation - to create a cabinet member responsible for tackling climate change - has already been implemented by the Labour-run council back in the summer, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
The task group report noted the need for the council to focus on its own carbon emissions, other local emissions that it can directly influence through its policies and community emissions that can be cut through partnerships between the council and other organisations.
It also suggested that the council carries out a study to explore whether it is feasible to maximise heat recovery at the city's crematorium in order to make it more energy efficient.

38,39,COP26,Steffan Messenger,Climate change: Wales COP26 events 'costly failure',2021-12-16,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-59670318,"A series of events held in Wales to coincide with the COP26 climate summit has been branded a costly ""failure"" by the Welsh Conservatives.
Figures obtained by the party show the Welsh government spent Â£235,000 on COP Cymru.
But the Tories claim the programme of debates and lectures resulted in little public or media interest.
The Welsh government said more than 3,800 people had attended the events online.
The series started days before the summit in Glasgow with the launch of the Welsh government's Net Zero plan - with a panel session in Port Talbot streamed live to a virtual audience.
A roadshow followed during COP26 itself- with four debate and discussion events held in different parts of Wales looking at energy, nature, climate change adaptation and transport.
This was followed by a Wales Climate Week at the end of November - a five-day programme of virtual events.  
A breakdown of the costs involved provided by the Welsh government show Â£53,600 was spent on staging and sound requirements, up to Â£135,000 on staffing and event management, Â£9,500 on a COP Cymru online platform, up to Â£23,000 on press and marketing, with about Â£13,490 on other costs.
Well-known Welsh presenters and journalists were invited to chair the discussions, which featured leading experts in environmental issues, as well as government ministers.
Recordings of each session have been posted online - while viewing figures are not visible, all of the videos bar one have yet to receive a single comment or ""like"".
The Tories alleged that COP Cymru had been used for ""rhetoric not action"" and had resulted in ""little to no new policy"" announcements beyond the initial Net Zero plan.  
Their climate change spokesperson in the Senedd, Janet Finch-Saunders MS said the whole thing had been a ""failure"".
""It's highly disappointing that hard earned taxpayer money was spent on events that were little more than self-promotion and ego stroking,"" she said. 
She claimed funding had been ""frittered away"" and that it would have been better spent on shoring up coal tips, which was ""such a priority for the people of Wales"".
But climate scientist Professor Mary Gagen of Swansea University said aspects of the criticism had ""made her blood boil"".
She was involved in several COP Cymru events, as well as producing a guide for Welsh schools on climate change and videos showcasing the efforts of university researchers in the field.
""What I thought was a real shame was saying that, because these weren't flashy media events that they weren't inspiring and weren't able to make a difference,"" she said.
""It's the exact opposite - what leads to positive change are those little moments where a school child is able to meet with a scientist, where a farmer is able to ask a question, they're never going to make the front page but they're really meaningful.
""For me COP Cymru generated thousands and thousands of those moments.""
Dr Anna Bullen of the Centre for Alternative Technology who also chaired one of the events said the livestreaming element made it ""hard to gauge"" how they were being received.
""Of course I want to see as much public engagement as possible but I wouldn't use that as a sole reason to end an event like this.""
""For our sector bringing together practitioners and experts, sharing views, understanding and research is so important,"" she said.
A spokesperson for the Welsh government said COP Cymru included an extensive programme of events, attracting more than 3,800 virtual attendees, 200 speakers and 38 sessions.
""Several fringe events were also held as there was too much demand for content to fit into a single programme,"" they said.
He added that if the government was to meet its net zero targets it was ""crucial we engage with people, businesses and organisations across Wales"".
""COP26 provided an international platform to show Wales is playing its part in tackling the threats of climate change and that we are listening and learning from experiences elsewhere,"" they said.
""COP Cymru brought the conversation closer to home and was an important opportunity to engage citizens across Wales, helping them understand the need for collective action and the role they can play."" 
On coal tip safety, he added it was the UK Government that was ""unwilling to take responsibility"" for the restoration work costs, currently estimated to be at least Â£500m.

39,40,COP26,Kayleen Devlin,The teenagers and the nun trying to stop an Australian coal mine,2021-12-15,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-59390798,"When eight teenagers and an elderly nun in Australia teamed up for a climate case, they won, in a historic judgement. Their case has now been appealed by the country's government. If the final verdict swings in their favour, it will have ramifications not just for Australian law but for climate cases world-wide. 
In May this year, Anjali Sharma was sitting in her economics class at school in Melbourne when the court in Sydney live-streamed the results of a climate case she had found herself at the centre of. It took a while to sink in. 
""To me it all just sounded like jargon. It took a briefing from my legal team to understand the magnitude of what had happened,"" she says. 
At that moment 17-year-old Ms Sharma and the seven other teenagers involved in her case had made history. Alongside 87-year-old Catholic nun Brigid Arthur, who acted as the young people's legal guardian, they'd taken Australia's environment minister, Sussan Ley, to court - and won.
""It felt really rewarding to be able to engage in something so historic for Australia, and needed too,"" says Ms Sharma.
Their case attempted to stop the expansion of the Vickery coal mine in New South Wales, which is estimated to add an extra 170 million tonnes of fossil fuel emissions to the atmosphere. 
The judge in their case, Mordy Bromberg, ruled that the government had a duty to protect young people against future harm related to climate change. It's the first time in the world that a duty of care of this kind has been recognised.
Justice Bromberg did not, however, grant them an injunction to prevent the expansion of the mine. In his view, the court didn't have any evidence that Sussan Ley would actually approve the extension, and any injunction would be pre-emptive.
Yet in September Ms Ley approved the extension of the Vickery coal mine, as well as three others since then. The government is also appealing the decision in the Sharma case - the outcome of which is due soon.
The government used a ""substitution argument"" as one reason to approve Vickery, says the lawyer representing the Sharma case, David Barnden.
""It's the argument that if this particular coal project didn't go ahead, it wouldn't make a difference to the total amount of emissions because effectively the market would fulfill that demand. That's otherwise known as the drug dealer's defence - it's the idea that 'If I don't deal drugs then somebody else will.'""
For Sister Brigid Arthur, the minister's decisions since the success of their case are ""quite provocative"".
Sister Arthur has spent a lifetime working with young people. For over two decades she has been acting as a litigation guardian - instructing lawyers on behalf of those who can't represent themselves - in cases mostly involving refugees. Before that she was a secondary school teacher. This is her first environmental case. 
""It's engaged young people in a way that seems quite extraordinary. It's certainly for me something new,"" she says.
She was approached by lawyers just over a year ago who asked her to act as the teenagers' litigation guardian. She didn't take much convincing.
""I'm pretty passionate about climate change and while I don't work directly in this area, I'm very conscious of the fact that it's important for people to do what they can.
""Young people are the ones who will inherit whatever we're doing now, so they have every right to be calling people to account.""
In speaking out, Ms Sharma has made herself a target for attacks.
""I've been messaged a lot of threats,"" she says.
""Some of the big news sources in Australia have, I guess, quite a right-wing following, so when news sources like that have covered my story I learned really quickly not to read the comments.""
A 2019 report which investigated four publications owned by Australia's most powerful media company, News Corp Australia, argued that they promoted climate scepticism. Of over 8,000 articles analysed, 45% of all items either rejected or cast doubt upon consensus scientific findings.
In response, a News Corp Australia spokesman said the year-old report was ""imbalanced"" and coming from ""a political activist group with a history of bias against our company's journalism"".
News Corp Australia recently has been viewed as softening its hostility towards climate action by advocating for net zero emissions by 2050.
Despite this, shortly before and during COP26, videos from News Corp-owned Sky News Australia were recycled and found traction on social media amongst climate sceptics.
One Sky News Australia segment in which the host condemns youth climate activists as ""selfish, badly educated, virtue-signalling little turds"" was shared by the head of the advocacy group the CO2 coalition and received over 45,000 likes and 16,000 retweets.
As the science of climate change has become harder to argue with, a growing and common tactic is often to shoot the messenger instead - often accusing them of hypocrisy. 
""Comments like 'Oh, she's wearing jeans and I bet she doesn't know how much water goes into producing a pair of jeans,'"" says Ms Sharma. ""And you know, they're right. I do own a pair of jeans. But me not owning that pair of jeans is not going to cut Australia's emissions in half by 2030.""
This video can not be played
When Sister Brigid first met the teenagers, who knew each other through attending climate protests, she was struck by their passion. She describes them as a group of young people ""who really believe in this, who feel like they can't stop"".
""There are very few greys with young people,"" she says. ""Everything is so black and white.""
But for now, all they can do is wait for the result of the appeal to be announced.
Despite widespread recognition of the need to move away from coal, there are different approaches when it comes to putting that knowledge into practice. At the COP26 summit in Glasgow, coal became a point of contention after delegates from China and India requested a last-minute change to the agreement, switching the phrase ""phase out"" coal with ""phase down"".
The results of the appeal and their case could be game-changing - not only for Australia but for other parts of the world too.
A success in their case could signal an erosion in support for fossil fuel burning and extraction with more lawsuits of this kind ahead. But if the minister's appeal is successful, it could see courts effectively vacate the climate field.
Australia is the world's second-largest exporter of coal. Following the Glasgow summit, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the coal industry will be operating in the country for ""decades to come"". He added that the plan to achieve net zero by 2050 will not come at the cost of rural and regional Australians. 
""The world is grappling with this collective action problem of climate change. Every mine has its part to play and every decision counts,"" says Mr Barnden.
""What the court found was that the emissions from this particular extension project could be the emissions that tip us over the edge to these nonlinear tipping points which would further accelerate climate change.""
He hopes that the duty of care ruling - if maintained through the appeal process - can influence other jurisdictions and give hope to young people to be able to participate in the legal process.
""It's a very foundational legal case to approach the problems caused by climate change, and the principles of negligence exist in a whole range of common law countries, from the UK, to New Zealand, Canada and the US as well.""
It's too soon to tell whether this case will provide a turning point on climate inaction. But for Ms Sharma and the other teenagers involved in her case, the time for action is now.
""I really hope the federal court realises that Australia is now running behind the rest of the world, and that the duty of care that my case seeks to establish is really, really needed right now.""

Anglican priest Reverend Sue Parfitt, 79, told the Royal Courts of Justice that it was of ""no consequence"" if she was jailed for breaching a High Court injunction by blocking a highway.
Seven members of the climate group appeared and admitted the allegations.
They are set to be sentenced on Wednesday.
The breaches relate to an Insulate Britain protest on the M25, which led to tailbacks of 2.5 miles (4km), when activists blocked the carriageways and glued themselves to the road.
Rev Parfitt, from Bristol, was applauded by members of the public when she addressed the judge about her determination to continue protesting in the event she is not jailed.
She told the court: ""It is of no consequence to me what you do with me today.
""If you leave me at liberty, I shall continue to protest in whatever way most dramatically draws attention to the plight we are all in - whether that involves breaking the law or not.""
Stephen Pritchard, 62, from Radstock in Somerset, said he ""will continue to block roads in peaceful protest regardless of the consequences for me personally"".
Steve Gower, 54, from Gloucester, claimed that he protested ""on behalf of people present and future not in a position to make their voices heard"".
He added: ""I will sleep tonight and thereafter with a clear conscience.""

41,42,Climate change,BBC News,"Arctic heat record is like Mediterranean, says UN",2021-12-14,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59649066,"The highest temperature ever recorded in the Arctic, 38C (100F), has been officially confirmed, sounding ""alarm bells"" over Earth's changing climate.
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) on Tuesday verified the record, reported in the Siberian town of Verkhoyansk on 20 June last year. 
The temperature was 18C higher than the area's average daily maximum for June.
The WMO, a UN agency, said the extreme heat was ""more befitting the Mediterranean than the Arctic"".
It is the first time the agency has included the Arctic Circle in its archive of extreme weather reports.
The WMO said the 38C temperature was measured at a meteorological station during ""an exceptional and prolonged Siberian heatwave"".
Last year's extreme heat in the region contributed to the spread of wildfires, which swept across the forests and peatlands of northern Russia releasing record amounts of carbon.
While relatively common in summer months, high temperatures and strong winds made the fires unusually severe.
The high temperatures across Siberia led to ""massive sea ice loss"" and played a major role in 2020 being one of the three warmest years on record, the WMO said.
The agency said its verification of the Verkhoyansk record highlighted how temperatures were increasing in a climatically important region of the world. 
""This new Arctic record is one of a series of observations reported to the WMO archive of Weather and Climate Extremes that sound the alarm bells about our changing climate,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.
Mr Taalas told the BBC that melting snow and ice in the Russian Arctic were boosting warming. 
""This is very much caused by changes in the radiation properties of the soil and the ocean... once we had snow cover, the radiation properties of the surface is very different from the dark soil or open sea,"" he said.
The WMO said it had added the Arctic Circle to its World Weather and Climate Extremes archive under a new category for high temperatures in the region.
The Arctic is one of the fastest warming regions in the world, heating at more than twice the global average, the WMO said. 
Warming in the Arctic is leading to the thawing of once permanently frozen permafrost below ground.
This is alarming scientists because as permafrost thaws, carbon dioxide and methane previously locked up below ground is released.
These greenhouse gases can cause further warming, and further thawing of the permafrost, in a vicious cycle known as positive feedback.
The higher temperatures also cause land ice in the Arctic to melt at a faster rate, leading to greater run-off into the ocean where it contributes to sea-level rise.
Human activity is contributing to a rise in world temperatures, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life.
Left unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species.

Already it is dumping 50 billion tonnes of ice into the ocean each year.
This is having limited impact on global sea-levels today, but there is sufficient ice held upstream in the glacier's drainage basin to raise the height of the oceans by 65cm - were it all to melt.
Such a ""doomsday"" scenario is unlikely to come about for many centuries, but the study team says Thwaites is now responding to a warming world in really quite rapid ways.
""There is going to be dramatic change in the front of the glacier, probably in less than a decade. Both published and unpublished studies point in that direction,"" said glaciologist Prof Ted Scambos, US lead coordinator for the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC). 
""This will accelerate the pace (of Thwaites) and widen, effectively, the dangerous part of the glacier,"" he told BBC News.
Thwaites is a colossus. It's roughly the size of Great Britain, or Florida, and its outflow speed has doubled in the past 30 years.
The ITGC has established how this is happening. It is the result of warm ocean water getting under - and melting - Thwaites's floating front, or ice shelf as it's known.
The warm water is thinning and weakening this ice, making it run faster and pushing back the zone where the main glacier body becomes buoyant.
At the moment, the leading edge of the eastern ice shelf is pinned in place by an offshore underwater ridge, which means its flow speed is a third of that seen in the ice shelf's western sector which has no such constraint.
But the ITGC team says the eastern shelf is likely to become uncoupled from the ridge in the next few years which will destabilise it. And even if the pinning persists, the ongoing development of fractures in the shelf ice will almost certainly break up the area anyway.

""I visualise it somewhat similar to that car window where you have a few cracks that are slowly propagating, and then suddenly you go over a bump in your car and the whole thing just starts to shatter in every direction,"" explained Dr Erin Pettit from Oregon State University.
The affected area is very small when considered in the context of the glacier as a whole, but it is the shift to a new regime and what this means for further ice loss that is the real significance.
At present, the eastern shelf, which has a width of about 40km, moves forward at about 600m per year. The coming change in status will probably see the following ice jump in speed to about 2km per year - the same as the current velocity recorded in the 80km-wide western sector.
Jointly funded by the US National Science Foundation and the UK's Natural Environment Research Council, the five-year ITGC project is putting Thwaites under unprecedented scrutiny. 
Each Antarctic summer season, teams of scientists are investigating the glacier's behaviour in every way possible. From satellite, on the ice, and from ships in front of Thwaites.
Those teams are en route for the new season right now, some in Covid quarantine ahead of their deployment to the field.
One of the projects for the New Year will see the tubby yellow submarine known as ""Boaty McBoatface"" dive under Thwaites' floating ice to gather data on water temperature, current direction and turbulence - all factors that influence melting.
The autonomous vehicle will go on missions lasting one to four days, navigating its own path through the cavity beneath the shelf. This is high risk as the seafloor terrain is extremely rugged. 
""It's scary. We might not get Boaty back,"" conceded Dr Alex Phillips from the UK's National Oceanography Centre.  
""We've put a lot of effort this past year into developing collision avoidance for the vehicle, to make sure it doesn't crash into the seabed. We also have contingencies whereby if it does get into trouble, it can retrace its steps and retreat to safety.""
The latest science on Thwaites Glacier is being presented this week at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in New Orleans.

44,45,Climate change,Jake Horton and Esme Stallard,US tornadoes: Is climate change to blame?,2021-12-13,https://www.bbc.com/news/59641376,"Several US states have been hit by a devastating series of tornadoes, with an expected death toll of more than 100.
These are extremely rare outside the spring and summer, in the US, but this December there has been a record number of tornado warnings. 
So is climate change causing more frequent and stronger tornadoes?
When warm moist air is trapped by cooler air, it causes thunder clouds to form.
The warm air rises, creating an updraft. 
And if there are also strong winds moving in different directions, the air column starts to rotate.
Increasing amounts of warm air are drawn in, speeding up the wind spiral, which then extends out of the bottom of the thunder clouds. 
And once this touches the ground, it is a tornado. 
There is more warm moist air in the hotter months.
And a cluster of tornadoes of this size and power in December is extremely unusual in the US.
Far more tornadoes have been recorded in the past 20 years than the previous 20 - but some of this is due to improved tracking.
As data-collecting methods have improved, less severe tornadoes have been recorded more consistently.
""To an untrained eye, it may look like we are having more of these events happening - but in reality what is happening is we have much better tools for identifying relatively weaker tornadoes,"" Dr Jana Houser, professor of meteorology, at the University of Ohio, says.
But clusters of tornadoes - when six or more start within six hours of each other - are becoming more likely.
And though there are now fewer days with tornadoes - on average about 100 compared with 150 in the 1970s - there are more tornadoes on those days.
No single weather event can be put down to climate change alone.
The increasing amount of tornado clusters ""clearly implies that the patterns of the atmosphere have changed"", meteorologist Harold Brooks, at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), says. 
""That may be related to climate change - but we cannot make a full conclusion,"" he adds.
Warmer temperatures make extreme weather events more likely and potentially more destructive.
But ""there is no scientific consensus"" on tornadoes, Mr Brooks says.
""It is not like the consensus on the increase in heatwaves or heavy rain at all.""
Wind speed and energy in the atmosphere are two of the main drivers of tornadoes - but there is a lack of definitive evidence on how they may change with a warming climate.  
At a briefing following the tornadoes, US President Joe Biden said he would ""be asking the Environmental Protection Agency and others to take a look at [the role of climate change].
""The fact is that we know everything is more intense when the climate is warming,"" he added.
In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found some ""conditions conducive to tornadoes such as atmospheric instability [will] increase due to increasing temperature and humidity"". 
But other conditions, which may lessen the likelihood of tornadoes, also exist.
There is no evidence tornadoes are becoming stronger, according to National Geographic Society research.
In fact, the US had had a ""tornado drought"", with no highest-category tornado since 2013. 
The most devastating of this weekend's tornadoes has become known as the Quad-State - cutting a swathe through Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky. 
It is not the wind speeds, though, that were record-breaking but its size.
It was reportedly three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) wide and travelled for more than 220 miles - considerably further than the distance from London to Paris.
On average, tornadoes are 50 yards wide and travel only a few miles, according to the National US Weather Service.
The most frequent tornadoes have traditionally been in a strip through the central US known as Tornado Alley.
This includes areas of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska.
But some evidence points towards a shift to having more tornadoes in the southern US.
Mr Brooks says: ""Tornado Alley is not well defined, so that is hard to say - if there is a definite shift.
""We have seen an increase in tornadoes of about 10% over 40 years in the mid-South region and a decrease in the Texas, Kansas sort of region. 
""It has shifted - but it is not a huge shift.""

The wind turbine and solar panel-powered restaurant is in Market Drayton, Shropshire.
Recycled IT equipment and household goods make up the building's cladding, signs are from used coffee beans and insulation is provided by sheep wool.
The fast-food company said it would be used as a ""blueprint"" for other sites and work has started to roll it out.
Net zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
It is the first restaurant in the UK due to be verified as net zero emissions for construction using the UK Green Building Council's (UKGBC's) net zero carbon buildings framework.  
The problems of decarbonising the construction industry were ""complex"", but the move by McDonald's was a ""critical first step"", UKGBC spokesman Simon McWhirter said.
McDonald's spokeswoman Beth Hart said: ""We've already started to roll out some of these innovations to other restaurants, but what is exciting about Market Drayton is the fact it will act as a blueprint for our future new builds.
""We believe that our food needs to be served in restaurants that are sustainable for the future. Market Drayton is a big step towards making that a reality.""
Senior lecturer in the environment and sustainability at Keele University, Dr Sharon George, said the move was a ""positive step"" and a sign that the company was recognising that ""society's view of sustainability"" was changing. 
McDonald's and other fast food suppliers have previously come under fire from investors who signed a letter asking the firms to reduce the carbon footprint of their meat and dairy supply chains.
The firm has said it has put in place strong climate targets for suppliers.

47,48,Storm Barra,BBC News,Logan Botanic Garden counts cost of Storm Barra damage,2021-12-10,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-59593527,"A botanic garden in south west Scotland is counting the cost of the damage caused by Storm Barra.
Curator Richard Baines said the destruction at the Port Logan site was ""heart-breaking"".
Logan Botanic Garden was in one of the areas worst affected by the storm on Tuesday, with wind gusts of more than 75mph (120kmh).
Mr Baines said it had caused damage to ""countless plants"" as well as the destruction of ""several prized trees"".
Logan, situated in Dumfries and Galloway, is a regional garden of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RGBE).
Among the trees damaged by the storm was one of the garden's best-known attractions, Polylepsis australis - known locally as the ""filo pastry tree"" because of its peeling bark.
The tree, runner-up in the 2018 Scottish Tree of the Year contest, had two large boughs torn from its trunk.
Experts said it would survive but had ""lost its majestic stature"".
Mr Baines said the damage had highlighted, with a ""ferocious roar"", the impact of climate change.
""This is the fiercest storm I have experienced in my 15 years as curator of the garden and it's heart-breaking to witness the damage and destruction of so many important trees,"" he said.
""It's another clear example of the impact of climate change on our natural environment and why the work of RGBE in researching and helping to conserve biodiversity is so crucial.""
The garden is home to 120 species that are threatened with extinction out of about 2,500 species in total.
It usually enjoys an ""almost subtropical climate"" allowing plants to flourish which would not survive elsewhere.
However, the wind direction and strength of Storm Barra caused significant damage, despite hedges which had been planted for protection.
Several eucalypts, wild-collected in Tasmania, were destroyed as were specimens of the critically-endangered Araucaria angustifolia (Brazilian pine), Acacia (florist's mimosa) and Callitris (cypress).
RBGE said these were trees which thrived at Logan but were hardly grown outside anywhere else in Scotland.
Scotland's national collection of Leptospermum scoparium or tea tree, which is hosted at the garden, was also affected with several trees blown out of the ground by the winds.
It has been estimated it will take about three weeks to clear up the damage and debris from the garden which is scheduled to reopen to the public on 1 March next year.

48,49,Climate change,BBC News,Climate change: Four cheap ways to save energy at home,2021-12-10,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58913875,"Making your home more energy efficient can be costly and may not be possible if you're renting, or you don't have thousands of pounds stashed away to buy new heat pumps and double glazing.
But there are some cheap solutions to try to save money. We've looked at where you are likely to be losing the most energy in your home and come up with some simple solutions to help save money on your bills and keep warm this winter.
Warm air wants to leave your home and will find any nook and cranny to do so. As it does, cold air is sucked in to replace it, causing draughts. It makes your home cold and wastes energy.
Shutting doors and closing windows may not be enough as any gaps in the frames allow warm air to escape - and that costs money. On this thermal image, the draughts show up as the coldest areas around a front door.
The coolest temperatures are black, purple and blue and the draughts are shown around the door in these colours, says James Richardson, of IRT Surveys - which uses thermal imaging to help home owners identify where heat is being lost.
The letter box, often an escape route for hot air, appears warm (red and yellow colours) so it is likely to be well-sealed and insulated. 
But by simply adding a draught excluder - or even a rolled up towel - the draughts can be blocked, as we can see in these before and after images:
Energy firms and energy-saving campaigners agree one of the simplest solutions to keeping out the cold is to use a draught excluder. Combined with draught-proofing of windows and doors, it could help cut around Â£25 a year off your bills. Special care needs to be taken in houses that have flueless gas appliances, which need some ventilation to operate safely.
Having a rolled-up towel by the front door may not be the most attractive household feature, but you can always try to make and decorate one yourself.
It is important to make sure the draught excluder covers the width of the door. And for a no-sew method, use strips of the discarded material to make ties and tie up each end of the trouser leg instead.
If you don't fancy cutting up your jeans you could just use a rectangular piece of material to make a tube and fill in a similar fashion. You'll end up with a more regular-shaped excluder.
For the really crafty, or Team GB Olympic gold medal-winning divers perhaps, Home Energy Scotland have a pattern for a knitted version.
Badly fitting windows or single panes of glass are another place heat is often lost. 
If you can't get windows replaced with double glazing, the Energy Saving Trust says it is worth getting some heavy curtains to help keep the heat in the room.
Again, the thermal images show how closing the curtains traps that heat in with you.
You may not want to sit in the dark all day, so look out for cheap DIY kits available that use a thin plastic sheet to cover the window, blocking draughts.
They are sometimes shrink-fitted into place with a hairdryer and can be removed and replaced as required.
Insulating your loft is like wearing a woolly hat - trapping the warmth below to keep you cosy. However, that hatch is just like any other door and needs attention too.
Even James was surprised by the thermal image showing heat being lost around the frame. But it's an easy fix, making sure it is snugly insulated around the edges.
One suggestion online is to glue a plastic bag to the back of the hatch, fill it some of the loft insulation and then seal it up. It should help insulate the hatch and flop over the edges when you pull it shut, stopping draughts escaping.
There are lots of little things we can do around the home that will help save energy and money that just require tweaks to our behaviour rather than installing, fitting or making anything.
Most energy companies will install a smart meter for free so you can help monitor your energy use and spending. 
But there are other small changes to your daily routine that cost nothing and save energy. The obvious ones are spending less time in the shower (potentially saving about Â£10 a year), turning off the lights (Â£14) or turning down the thermostat (saving up toÂ£55).
The Eco-Experts blog recommends ""heating the humans, not the building"" - so perhaps don't keep the central heating on all the time if you're not cold, and don't heat rooms you're not in. 
Other ideas include:
And finally there is the old favourite - repeated by parents down the ages and still on the advice the elderly by Age UK - if you're cold, put on an extra layer - several thin layers of clothing will keep you warmer than one thick layer, as the layers trap warm air between them.

But David Scott Smith, 66, and Travis Shane Smith, 32, were poised to dispute accusations of ""reckless arson"" related to the Caldor Fire. 
They are being held on $1m (Â£760,000) bail and have not yet been charged.
The Caldor scorched more than 220,000 acres over two months.
It grew to become the 15th largest fire ever recorded in California, razing over 1,000 structures, injuring five people and forcing thousands to flee before it was contained in October.
After their arrest on Wednesday, Mark Reichel, attorney for the Smiths, told The New York Times that the pair were baffled by the suggestion that they were responsible for the fire. 
They had been in Eldorado National Forest this past summer when they spotted a fire, Mr Reichel said. They tried to call 911 but could not find signal. 
""As we sit here tonight, we have no idea what the prosecution's theory is on how the fire started,"" he told the newspaper. 
The El Dorado County District Attorney's Office did not provide details about what the men were accused of having done. The Smiths were arrested on a ""Ramey warrant"", which is when someone is taken into custody before charges are filed. 
In a statement, the DA's office said they were accused of violating a section of state law commonly referred to as ""reckless arson"", which caused inhabited buildings to burn and resulted in great bodily injury to multiple victims. 
""About 95% of fires are human caused"", said Nick Schuler of Cal Fire, California's biggest fire agency. ""That doesn't mean intentionally caused.""
Dry, hot weather has left conditions ""so critical"" that person driving home from a camping trip pulling a trailer along a roadway could cause ""dozens"" of fire, Mr Schuler told the BBC. 
In California, about 10% of wildfires are set intentionally, according to the agency. 
Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.
The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.
