0,1,Climate change,Louise Cullen,Poots launches consultation on Future Agricultural Policy,2021-12-21,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-northern-ireland-59749071,"the agriculture minister has launched a consultation on policy proposals for the future agriculture policy  
it is based on four outcomes  productivity environmental sustainability improved resilience and an effectively functioning supply chain  
the aim is to try to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions from farming 
agriculture as a sector is the largest emitter in northern ireland  
among the proposals are a reduction in the age at which cattle would go to slaughter a farming for nature package and a farming for carbon package 
farming for nature is expected to form a central plank of agricultural support over time  
its main focus will be on improving biodiversity on farms through measures like hedgerows integration of trees within crops and livestock farming and protected areas  
the farming for carbon strand aims to reduce the carbon footprint of the agricultural industry through a number of proposals including reducing the number of older cattle for slaughter improved genetics and feed additives  
the agriculture minister said designing the policy was a unique opportunity to redefine agricultural policy
edwin poots also said it was a chance to target support to meet local priorities and needs much more effectively
as we build out this future portfolio i want to ensure that farmers are supported and equipped with the right tools to continue producing high quality nutritious food whilst importantly also reducing their environmental impact he added
the consultation is open until 15 february 2022 with early findings to be published early in the year

2,3,Climate change,Jesse Preyser,Miners experiment with hydrogen to power giant trucks,2021-12-21,http://www.bbc.com//news/business-59576867,"mining trucks are monstrous machines that guzzle fuel at a scarcely believable rate
weighing 220 tonnes they can get through 134 litres of diesel every hour 
little wonder then that mining companies are focusing their attention on these vehicles as the first step to reducing their carbon footprint
anglo american in collaboration with several partners is retrofitting a mining haul truck with hydrogen power technology
a first of its kind the monster mining vehicle is being piloted in limpopo south africa at the firm's mogalakwena platinum mine 
due to be launched in early 2022 the truck will be hybrid with a hydrogen fuel cell providing roughly half of the power and a battery pack the other half 
instead of having a tank of diesel that powers the motor hydrogen enters the fuel cell and mixes with oxygen to create water in a chemical reaction catalysed by platinum which generates the electricity needed to power the motors that drive the wheels
it only emits water vapour and the company says it has the potential to reduce onsite diesel emissions by up to 80
by rolling out this technology across its global truck fleet anglo american says it will be taking the equivalent of half a million diesel cars off the road 
the trucks also harvest regenerative energy created when driving downhill and braking which is stored in the battery and extends the range of the vehicle
anglo is developing the truck along with partners engie nproxx first mode williams advanced engineering ballard abb nel and plug power
however reducing the carbon footprint of the mining industry is a formidable task
the construction sector which includes mining accounted for 36 of global final energy use and 39 of energyrelated co2 emissions in 2017 according to davide sabbadin senior policy officer for climate and circular economy at the european environmental bureau eeb
he says the sector will need to reduce its energy consumption by a third if it hopes to be compatible with the paris agreement
hydrogenpowered trucks are a good start but need closer inspection says diego marin associate policy officer for environmental justice at the eeb 
while electricpowered vehicles generally speaking are less damaging to the environment than internal combustion engines on a life cycle analysis this does not mean that they are green he says
mr marin points out it all hinges on how the hydrogen is produced some hydrogen is created using fossil fuels which of course means there are substantial emissions as a result
anglo american says it is pulling out all the stops in an attempt to attain carbon neutrality by 2040
its hydrogenpowered hauler uses green hydrogen which is made by splitting water atoms into oxygen and hydrogen through electrolysis
even that is treated with caution by the eeb 
we should refrain from presenting hydrogen as a technological solution to all problemsâ¦ all forms of hydrogen come at an environmental cost  water use impacts on nature says mr sabbadin 
the eeb also points out that hydrogen power has a shorter storage life than other renewables and is substantially more expensive to produce  
more technology of business
whether it be investment for the mining industry's green goals or hydrogen power as a broader power solution the issue of cost is definitely a pertinent one in south africa 
jarrad wright an energy consultant and principal engineer for the council for scientific and industrial research csir explains 
hydrogen for power production is still quite expensive and unlikely to compete for some time 
this is largely due to a lack of supporting infrastructure for the new forms of energy to be created distributed or stored 
but mr wright adds that it is possible to migrate to hydrogen in specific applications 
at the moment south africa's hydrogen power infrastructure is still sparse
but the government and private partners are exploring ways to transform the country's platinum belt into a hydrogen valley with a focus on producing green hydrogen
anglo american is one of the private partners in this hydrogen infrastructure plan which aims to create a regional renewable energy ecosystem 
the starting point for this ecosystem is due to be built at the mogalakwena mine itself through the construction of a hydrogen production and storage complex it incorporates the largest electrolyser in africa a solar power field and will generate approximately 140mw of green power 
initially it will be to support the 24hour operation of the new truck but once operational the aim is for numerous complexes such as this one to serve as local and regional hubs for the emerging hydrogen economy
the ecosystem would not only help us reduce our emissions but would also provide the foundation for green hydrogen production facilitating the rollout of hydrogenpowered haul trucks across south africa anglo says

3,4,Budget 2021,BBC News,Welsh budget: Bumper funding rise for Welsh NHS amid backlog,2021-12-20,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-wales-politics-59720795,"nhs spending in wales will jump next year to tackle record high waiting times created by covid
an extra â£893m will be pumped in during 2022 as part of the â£246bn welsh government budget
more cash has also been promised for councils and labour finance minister rebecca evans said the budget will help make wales a fairer nation
welsh conservatives said the budget had been made possible after record funding from the uk government
shops and hospitality will get a 50 cut to business rates  a relief to some firms waiting to hear if there would be any help for the tax from april
plaid cymru said the spending plans will deliver a stronger wales following the party's cooperation agreement with welsh labour ministers
the welsh government say that over three years it will provide â£13bn in extra direct funding to the welsh nhs
most of that  â£893m  will arrive in the first financial year that is a 107 increase on the current budget or 78 when inflation is taken into account with smaller increases in later years
numbers waiting for treatments hit record levels last august
budget documents say the government's highest priority is to address the backlog of treatments that have been delayed by the pandemic
helen whyley of the royal college of nurses said a significant portion has to be spent on nhs salaries with 1719 vacancies in wales
the union is currently in dispute with the welsh government over pay
you can have all the money in the world for services ms whyley said but if you don't have the staff to care for patients and to deliver that care safely it won't buy you anything
despite the rise in daytoday spending funding for health care facilities will fall from â£377m to â£279m next year
the welsh nhs confederation which represents health organisations said its members are disappointed in the lack of investment in capital infrastructure to improve and redesign nhs estates and facilities
cardiff university's guto ifan said the planned increase for nhs spending in wales appears to be slightly below extra cash for wales triggered because of nhs spending in england
there are huge uncertainties about the mediumterm impact of the pandemic and these spending plans could well need to be revised upwards in later years
council funding will increase by â£384m to â£51bn  81 in nominal terms or 52 when inflation is taken into account
officials say this is the largest increase to the cash for local government  which is spent on social care and other services  since devolution began
mr ifan said councils should be able to meet their spending needs next year with relatively low increases in council tax
the announcement follows a promise of more cash for welsh public services from the treasury which provides the lion's share of the welsh government's money
experts at cardiff university say â£29bn will be available to spend by 2024
it also comes after an agreement between the welsh government and plaid cymru which included free school meals over three years and expanding free childcare to twoyearolds
both were included in the budget with â£30m for early years and childcare and â£90m for free school meals over three years
according to the welsh government businesses in retail leisure and hospitality will receive 50 rates relief for 202223 matching similar plans announced by chancellor rishi sunak for england
it will be less than the 100 discount many such firms receive now the scheme will be capped at â£110000 per business
with other relief schemes ministers say 85000 properties will be supported while a further â£35m will be spent to freeze rates for 202223
despite the announcement michael manghan and rhian davies who run the crown and sceptre in cadoxton neath are still concerned for what 2022 will hold
ms davies feared the rate bill they would now need to pay was a big chunk of money to find
she said she would have like to have seen more but added it's better than nothing
mr manghan said the money we've lost over the last year  we're only just coming back to repay people
sam dabb who runs le pub in newport was pleased to hear the news it's one of the main costs of the business it's absolutely massive
one businessman said the welsh government definitely had to meet the 50 cut introduced in england and warned next year could be tough
the vale resort in hensol vale of glamorgan is starting to recover after a difficult 21 months 
bookings have increased since covid restrictions were lifted and the company has opened a distillery on site to expand the business 
its managing director stephen leeke said government support schemes such as furlough business rate relief and the economic resilience fund erf had helped the company stay afloat 
he said there's certainly an argument to say that they might consider going further because i think we are in for a bit of a roller coaster now in the next couple of months and i don't think there's any doubt the industry will need some support
the welsh government said it would spend â£18bn on investments in its climate change department over three years which includes â£16bn on housing
of that â£1bn will be spent on housing and â£375m for building safety
finance minister rebecca evans said the welsh government was still operating in a difficult financial context with our budget nearly â£3bn lower than if it had increased in line with the economy since 201011
this budget will support the wales of today and shape the wales of tomorrow it will support our public services to be stronger put wales further down the path to being a net zero nation and create a fairer nation with equality at its heart she said
welsh conservative finance spokesman peter fox said today's budget has been made possible by the conservative government delivering record funding for wales
in that light i welcome the muchneeded business rates holiday to help firms recover from the ongoing challenges of the pandemic along with an important uplift in funding for our local authorities who deliver so many key services in communities across wales
llyr gruffydd plaid cymru finance spokesperson said thanks to plaid cymru this budget will deliver an even fairer even greener even stronger wales through ambitious policy pledges
from free school meals for all primary pupils to extending free childcare to all twoyear olds and much more the commitments secured by plaid cymru as part of the cooperation agreement with welsh government will secure transformational support for some of our poorest households and will change people's lives for the better across wales
there will be relief among the many thousands working in hospitality retail and leisure across wales
the welsh government has matched what is happening in england and business rates for those industries will be halved most of them will still struggle to pay that as the pandemic continues to play havoc with trade with fewer people out shopping
with a new welsh government department focused on climate change it's hardly surprising that it's getting more money what is interesting and tells us about the departments priorities is that of the â£18bn for capital spending by the climate change minister almost all of it â£16bn is to improve the quality and supply of housing   
this budget is taking the long term view even though the immediate economic landscape is extremely fragile

4,5,Climate change,BBC News,Calls for 'reasoned debate' over oil and gas future,2021-12-19,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-59717784,"business leaders have written a joint open letter to party leaders calling for a reasoned debate over the future of oil and gas in the uk
the call comes after plans for the controversial cambo oil field off shetland were put on hold 
the letter says any statements calling for an end to new exploration have shaken investor confidence placing tens of thousands of jobs at risk
it warns politicians against creating a hostile investment environment
the letter from aberdeen  grampian chamber of commerce supported by the british chambers of commerce and scottish chambers of commerce has also been signed by 58 leading figures from business and civic life in aberdeen
it says the economic wellbeing of whole communities across the uk is also being put at risk
the letter adds that the statements calling for an end to new exploration threaten the very basis of a fair and inclusive transition at the most crucial point in our collective journey to a netzero society 
a transition by definition is a change of state over time it says this is one of the most complex challenges we have faced in our history and it doesn't lend itself to a simple 'who's good who's bad who's green who's not' approach to characterise it in this way is overly simplistic 
we must now pause and allow for a reasoned debate about our energy future to take place at the same time we urge politicians to reflect carefully on their public statements on oil and gas and the impact they have on investment in the industry
we must not create an adverse policy environment at this crucial moment in our energy transition journey
the letter adds that by 2050 the international energy agency projects that global oil and gas demand will fall by 80 but 20 million barrels per day will still be needed 
therefore there is no current future scenario where there is not a requirement for some oil and gas it says meantime it continues to be required for people to travel heat and power their homes and for the manufacture of many everyday goods 
this leaves us with two options to produce this domestically with full control over the regulatory environment in which it is extracted or to import an increasing amount of our energy with the heavier carbon toll that shipping it from other parts of the world carries the latter makes little economic sense and even less environmental sense
russell borthwick chief executive of aberdeen  grampian chamber of commerce said we have a shared interest in getting to net zero as quickly as possible but over recent months our region has been portrayed as part of the problem rather than part of the solution
the reality is that the skills people and experience embedded in the northeast of scotland have quietly been leading the way in moving the uk towards its netzero targets without any intervention from cop26 
however turning the north sea into a hostile investment environment today does nothing to support that transition in fact it does the opposite driving investment and tens of thousands of jobs away to other regions of the world
he added that the energytransition opportunity for aberdeen could be bigger than the oil and gas industry  but to get there strong leaders were needed who were willing to cut through the noise see the big picture and get our transition steps in the right order to protect jobs provide retraining opportunities and create new ones
deirdre michie chief executive of oguk which represents the uk's offshore oil and gas industry said right now we need oil and gas for 73 of our total energy and so the transition to carbon neutrality will be a huge and complex task  
we will only be able to achieve it with careful planning by policymakers who think longterm to develop clear government policies that are then supported by all politicians working together in the national interest 
she said that for years to come oil and gas needed to be part of the energy mix 
it will be far better for the nation and the environment if we source these fuels from around our shores rather than relying on even more imports  she added

5,6,Climate change,BBC News,Bangor's Hirael sea defences 'in various states of disrepair',2021-12-18,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-wales-59709880,"plans have been drawn up to build 600m 1970ft of new defences to protect properties from floods and rising sea levels
existing defences are in various states of disrepair at hirael in bangor a report submitted to gwynedd council has said
the sea level is projected to rise 12m 39ft by the end of this century the local democracy reporting service said 
the area has previously been hit by severe flooding in 1923 and 1973
parts of bangor have been identified as being at risk of flooding due to climate change
the lowlying hirael area faces a combination of factors including an expected rise in sea levels and flooding the river adda as it empties into the sea 
the plans at beach road showed the wall would be raised 13m 4ft 3in above the existing level of the seafront promenade other plans include
designed by ymgynghoriaeth gwynedd consultancy the supporting documents said the existing coastal defences at hirael are limited with the only formal defences in the area being a sea wall which in various states of disrepair a revetment and gabion baskets at the coastal frontage north east of beach road 
currently there are no other structures that manage wave overtopping and inundation 
temporary flood barriers such as sandbags have been deployed in the past along the length of the sea wall and two slipways to deal with high tides and wave surges but are not a sufficient source of longterm flood protection
it is expected that gwynedd council's planning department will consider the application in the coming months

6,7,Climate change,Becky Morton,Climate change: How can renters make their homes warmer and greener?,2021-12-18,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-59223081,"making the uk's ageing housing more energy efficient will be key to the country reaching its climate targets  but campaign groups representing renters and landlords say more action is needed to drive improvements
at one point you could see your breath in the living room it was that cold says erin davy 
the 29yearold was renting a twobedroom flat in melbourn cambridgeshire 
the letting agent had given an estimate of around â£80 a month for the electricity bill but when she moved in her direct debit ended up being just under â£200 a month  and over winter her monthly bill soared to as much as â£400 a month 
privately renting now is so expensive for young people as it is just the rent let alone having a massive energy bill on top of it she says it was crippling 
erin's boyfriend had lost his job at the beginning of the pandemic so the couple were relying on her wage alone to pay the bills  and she had to increase her overdraft to cover it 
the ballooning costs meant they had to be careful about when to turn the heating on and rarely used the living room because it was so difficult to heat 
after asking their landlord to take action he replaced their old storage heaters with newer models  but it didn't help the problem was the flat didn't seem to stay warm at all 
as a converted outhouse the building was badly insulated especially the floors and walls 
poor insulation doesn't just mean higher bills for renters  it also has an impact on the environment heating buildings contributes to almost a quarter of all uk emissions and the more heat that escapes through walls and roofs the more energy is wasted 
for erin things got so bad that she asked for an inspection by the council's environmental health team who found the inadequate heating was a health and safety hazard 
but the more she asked their landlord to make improvements she says the less responsive he became eventually the landlord served them with an eviction notice saying he wanted the flat back for his own use 
erin says the experience of being evicted was horrible but they managed to find somewhere else to live 
we couldn't have stayed there  we couldn't afford it she says i couldn't have done another winter in a freezing cold house
if you think your energy bills are too high or your home isn't staying warm the first thing to do is check its energy performance certificate epc online says dan wilson craw from campaign group generation rent 
buildings are graded between a  the most energy efficient  and g in england and wales homes must have a rating of at least e to be rented out with only limited exemptions the government has also consulted on raising the minimum standard to band c 
in scotland the government plans to require privately rented properties to have a rating of at least c from 2025 
damp or mould is another sign that your home may be poorly insulated 
there is government advice available online on how to make your home more energy efficient which mr craw advises renters look at before approaching their landlord 
but if landlords refuse to take action you can ask the local council to carry out an inspection councils are responsible for enforcing health and safety standards of homes and if they find serious issues with damp or heating they can force the landlord to make improvements 
mr craw says there are also grants and funding available through some councils and energy companies to help make your home more energy efficient if you're on a low income 
however research by generation rent suggests many renters are reluctant to demand or invest in improvements because they are unsure whether they will live in a home long enough to benefit from the cheaper bills 
others may be worried that if their landlord does pay for improvements they may increase the rent to recoup costs or even evict them 
mr craw says government plans to abolish section 21 no fault evictions which would prevent landlords evicting tenants without good reason will help give renters more certainty about how long they will be living somewhere 
generation rent also supports raising minimum energy efficiency standards for rented homes  and wants tenants to be able to claim back rent if landlords break the rules 
and the group wants to limit the amount landlords can increase rent for existing tenants to wage inflation to avoid them upping the rent if they are forced to pay for improvements 
for landlords the main barrier to making improvements is cost according to chris norris from the national residential landlords association 
nearly one in five households in england live in the private rented sector but this type of housing tends to be older and more difficult to insulate 
the average cost of bringing a privately rented home up to epc c standard is â£7646 according to the government 
and while landlords must pay for any changes to their property they generally don't see the benefits of lower bills 
mr norris says the grants available are quite limited 
the government recently announced grants of â£5000 would be available to people in england and wales from next april to replace their gas boilers with lowcarbon heat pumps to help cut greenhouse gas emissions 
but heat pumps can cost between â£6000 and â£18000  not including any expensive new insulation that may also be needed  so the subsidy would not cover the total cost 
as well as more generous grants the association also wants to see tax deducted from spending on energy efficiency to give landlords an extra financial incentive 
with gas prices surging mr craw says making homes more energy efficient is even more urgent 
if you could address it you can improve standards of life for private renters and cut carbon emissions he says but it requires action from the government to do that

8,9,Storm Dennis,Matthew Murray,Climate change: Young activists snub award,2021-12-17,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-wales-59690009,"young members of an environmental group have turned down an award from a council accusing it of not doing enough to tackle climate change
pontypridd's young friends of the earth has been campaigning for changes to address the climate emergency 
it said rhondda cynon taf council has not done enough since the devastating floods in 2020 after storm dennis 
group member alice 13 said it would be hypocritical for us to take the award
we feel rhondda cynon taf council  and the world  isn't taking action against climate change she added 
the major changes we could do as a county would be big decisions and not small daytoday ones 
because if you sit in a house which is on fire you wouldn't just sit there as the flames surrounded you and start making a plan how you're going to deal with the fire
you're going to act immediately and get water and you're going to put the fire out you wouldn't sit there doing nothing the world isn't in the best shape and they're not doing enough about it
alice added that there was action immediately when the pandemic hit and the same needed to be done for the climate change emergency
we need that with climate change because if we don't get it sorted out we might not be here
when storm dennis caused widespread flooding across south wales in february 2020 pontypridd was one of the worst affected towns 
homes and businesses were hit with the middle of the town centre flooded after the river taff burst its banks 
when we saw the town flood last year we knew climate change was getting worse and despite what people were saying about it getting better because it's not said alice 
i felt terrified when i saw water running down the main street because if water can reach that high because of a storm imagine what it will be like in 10 years
dan 12 another member of young friends of the earth said i would have expected rhondda cynon taf council to declare a climate emergency after the welsh government did 
they are one of the few councils in wales not to declare it and after storm dennis i'd have thought it would have been the first thing they would have done 
i fear with the melting ice caps much of the welsh coast and rct will get completely flooded and we'll lose whole towns and people's homes so we need to take action so we don't lose all the history too
rowan 10 said they thought it would generate more publicity to turn down the award than accept it
i don't think people understand how bad things are i find it traumatising when i think to the future
i might have a future with crumbling mountains and suffocating air and i don't want that to happen
council leader andrew morgan replied to a letter from the group declining the award saying the council is committed to achieving net zero by 2030 and has already made progress towards achieving this commitment to meet and contribute to global national and local targets

9,10,Climate change,BBC News,Preston's City's carbon neutral aim poses 'financial challenge',2021-12-17,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-england-lancashire-59696406,"a city council's aim to become carbon neutral by 2030 poses a financial challenge a report has found
a crossparty task group has spent almost two years exploring what preston city council needs to do to fulfil the pledge made in april 2019
the report said decisions would have to be taken ensure the greatest carbon reduction can be achieved at the earliest opportunity
but its fleet of 124 vehicles will remain dieseldriven
councillors voted for the authority to invest a further â£48m over the next five years in replacing the vehicles but an accompanying report said it was not currently possible to purchase alternative fuelled vehicles because of the lack of the necessary infrastructure to operate them
environment and community safety cabinet member robert boswell defended the decision not to shift the fleet to electric at this point warning that if the council had to charge all of its vehicles there might be power failures in preston because there are other factors to consider
he suggested that the authority faced the same practical barriers to electric vehicles that were experienced by some members of the public including a lack of charging points
the new vehicles that we will be moving to though not electronic vehicles have a reduction in emissions and have potential for fuel savings and more efficient engines he said
liberal democrat group leader john potter branded the report disappointing and said the council would not achieve its carboncutting aims
however the labour chair of the task group james hull said it demonstrated that the authority would have a robust climate change agenda at the forefront of all its work
the main recommendation  to create a cabinet member responsible for tackling climate change  has already been implemented by the labourrun council back in the summer the local democracy reporting service said
the task group report noted the need for the council to focus on its own carbon emissions other local emissions that it can directly influence through its policies and community emissions that can be cut through partnerships between the council and other organisations
it also suggested that the council carries out a study to explore whether it is feasible to maximise heat recovery at the city's crematorium in order to make it more energy efficient

10,11,COP26,Steffan Messenger,Climate change: Wales COP26 events 'costly failure',2021-12-16,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-wales-59670318,"a series of events held in wales to coincide with the cop26 climate summit has been branded a costly failure by the welsh conservatives
figures obtained by the party show the welsh government spent â£235000 on cop cymru
but the tories claim the programme of debates and lectures resulted in little public or media interest
the welsh government said more than 3800 people had attended the events online
the series started days before the summit in glasgow with the launch of the welsh government's net zero plan  with a panel session in port talbot streamed live to a virtual audience
a roadshow followed during cop26 itself with four debate and discussion events held in different parts of wales looking at energy nature climate change adaptation and transport
this was followed by a wales climate week at the end of november  a fiveday programme of virtual events  
a breakdown of the costs involved provided by the welsh government show â£53600 was spent on staging and sound requirements up to â£135000 on staffing and event management â£9500 on a cop cymru online platform up to â£23000 on press and marketing with about â£13490 on other costs
wellknown welsh presenters and journalists were invited to chair the discussions which featured leading experts in environmental issues as well as government ministers
recordings of each session have been posted online  while viewing figures are not visible all of the videos bar one have yet to receive a single comment or like
the tories alleged that cop cymru had been used for rhetoric not action and had resulted in little to no new policy announcements beyond the initial net zero plan  
their climate change spokesperson in the senedd janet finchsaunders ms said the whole thing had been a failure
it's highly disappointing that hard earned taxpayer money was spent on events that were little more than selfpromotion and ego stroking she said 
she claimed funding had been frittered away and that it would have been better spent on shoring up coal tips which was such a priority for the people of wales
but climate scientist professor mary gagen of swansea university said aspects of the criticism had made her blood boil
she was involved in several cop cymru events as well as producing a guide for welsh schools on climate change and videos showcasing the efforts of university researchers in the field
what i thought was a real shame was saying that because these weren't flashy media events that they weren't inspiring and weren't able to make a difference she said
it's the exact opposite  what leads to positive change are those little moments where a school child is able to meet with a scientist where a farmer is able to ask a question they're never going to make the front page but they're really meaningful
for me cop cymru generated thousands and thousands of those moments
dr anna bullen of the centre for alternative technology who also chaired one of the events said the livestreaming element made it hard to gauge how they were being received
of course i want to see as much public engagement as possible but i wouldn't use that as a sole reason to end an event like this
for our sector bringing together practitioners and experts sharing views understanding and research is so important she said
a spokesperson for the welsh government said cop cymru included an extensive programme of events attracting more than 3800 virtual attendees 200 speakers and 38 sessions
several fringe events were also held as there was too much demand for content to fit into a single programme they said
he added that if the government was to meet its net zero targets it was crucial we engage with people businesses and organisations across wales
cop26 provided an international platform to show wales is playing its part in tackling the threats of climate change and that we are listening and learning from experiences elsewhere they said
cop cymru brought the conversation closer to home and was an important opportunity to engage citizens across wales helping them understand the need for collective action and the role they can play 
on coal tip safety he added it was the uk government that was unwilling to take responsibility for the restoration work costs currently estimated to be at least â£500m

11,12,COP26,Kayleen Devlin,The teenagers and the nun trying to stop an Australian coal mine,2021-12-15,http://www.bbc.com//news/world-australia-59390798,"when eight teenagers and an elderly nun in australia teamed up for a climate case they won in a historic judgement their case has now been appealed by the country's government if the final verdict swings in their favour it will have ramifications not just for australian law but for climate cases worldwide 
in may this year anjali sharma was sitting in her economics class at school in melbourne when the court in sydney livestreamed the results of a climate case she had found herself at the centre of it took a while to sink in 
to me it all just sounded like jargon it took a briefing from my legal team to understand the magnitude of what had happened she says 
at that moment 17yearold ms sharma and the seven other teenagers involved in her case had made history alongside 87yearold catholic nun brigid arthur who acted as the young people's legal guardian they'd taken australia's environment minister sussan ley to court  and won
it felt really rewarding to be able to engage in something so historic for australia and needed too says ms sharma
their case attempted to stop the expansion of the vickery coal mine in new south wales which is estimated to add an extra 170 million tonnes of fossil fuel emissions to the atmosphere 
the judge in their case mordy bromberg ruled that the government had a duty to protect young people against future harm related to climate change it's the first time in the world that a duty of care of this kind has been recognised
justice bromberg did not however grant them an injunction to prevent the expansion of the mine in his view the court didn't have any evidence that sussan ley would actually approve the extension and any injunction would be preemptive
yet in september ms ley approved the extension of the vickery coal mine as well as three others since then the government is also appealing the decision in the sharma case  the outcome of which is due soon
the government used a substitution argument as one reason to approve vickery says the lawyer representing the sharma case david barnden
it's the argument that if this particular coal project didn't go ahead it wouldn't make a difference to the total amount of emissions because effectively the market would fulfill that demand that's otherwise known as the drug dealer's defence  it's the idea that 'if i don't deal drugs then somebody else will'
for sister brigid arthur the minister's decisions since the success of their case are quite provocative
sister arthur has spent a lifetime working with young people for over two decades she has been acting as a litigation guardian  instructing lawyers on behalf of those who can't represent themselves  in cases mostly involving refugees before that she was a secondary school teacher this is her first environmental case 
it's engaged young people in a way that seems quite extraordinary it's certainly for me something new she says
she was approached by lawyers just over a year ago who asked her to act as the teenagers' litigation guardian she didn't take much convincing
i'm pretty passionate about climate change and while i don't work directly in this area i'm very conscious of the fact that it's important for people to do what they can
young people are the ones who will inherit whatever we're doing now so they have every right to be calling people to account
in speaking out ms sharma has made herself a target for attacks
i've been messaged a lot of threats she says
some of the big news sources in australia have i guess quite a rightwing following so when news sources like that have covered my story i learned really quickly not to read the comments
a 2019 report which investigated four publications owned by australia's most powerful media company news corp australia argued that they promoted climate scepticism of over 8000 articles analysed 45 of all items either rejected or cast doubt upon consensus scientific findings
in response a news corp australia spokesman said the yearold report was imbalanced and coming from a political activist group with a history of bias against our company's journalism
news corp australia recently has been viewed as softening its hostility towards climate action by advocating for net zero emissions by 2050
despite this shortly before and during cop26 videos from news corpowned sky news australia were recycled and found traction on social media amongst climate sceptics
one sky news australia segment in which the host condemns youth climate activists as selfish badly educated virtuesignalling little turds was shared by the head of the advocacy group the co2 coalition and received over 45000 likes and 16000 retweets
as the science of climate change has become harder to argue with a growing and common tactic is often to shoot the messenger instead  often accusing them of hypocrisy 
comments like 'oh she's wearing jeans and i bet she doesn't know how much water goes into producing a pair of jeans' says ms sharma and you know they're right i do own a pair of jeans but me not owning that pair of jeans is not going to cut australia's emissions in half by 2030
this video can not be played
when sister brigid first met the teenagers who knew each other through attending climate protests she was struck by their passion she describes them as a group of young people who really believe in this who feel like they can't stop
there are very few greys with young people she says everything is so black and white
but for now all they can do is wait for the result of the appeal to be announced
despite widespread recognition of the need to move away from coal there are different approaches when it comes to putting that knowledge into practice at the cop26 summit in glasgow coal became a point of contention after delegates from china and india requested a lastminute change to the agreement switching the phrase phase out coal with phase down
the results of the appeal and their case could be gamechanging  not only for australia but for other parts of the world too
a success in their case could signal an erosion in support for fossil fuel burning and extraction with more lawsuits of this kind ahead but if the minister's appeal is successful it could see courts effectively vacate the climate field
australia is the world's secondlargest exporter of coal following the glasgow summit australian prime minister scott morrison said the coal industry will be operating in the country for decades to come he added that the plan to achieve net zero by 2050 will not come at the cost of rural and regional australians 
the world is grappling with this collective action problem of climate change every mine has its part to play and every decision counts says mr barnden
what the court found was that the emissions from this particular extension project could be the emissions that tip us over the edge to these nonlinear tipping points which would further accelerate climate change
he hopes that the duty of care ruling  if maintained through the appeal process  can influence other jurisdictions and give hope to young people to be able to participate in the legal process
it's a very foundational legal case to approach the problems caused by climate change and the principles of negligence exist in a whole range of common law countries from the uk to new zealand canada and the us as well
it's too soon to tell whether this case will provide a turning point on climate inaction but for ms sharma and the other teenagers involved in her case the time for action is now
i really hope the federal court realises that australia is now running behind the rest of the world and that the duty of care that my case seeks to establish is really really needed right now
