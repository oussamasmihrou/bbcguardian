0,1,Climate change,Louise Cullen,Poots launches consultation on Future Agricultural Policy,2021-12-21,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-northern-ireland-59749071,"The agriculture minister has launched a consultation on policy proposals for the Future Agriculture Policy.  
It is based on four outcomes - productivity, environmental sustainability, improved resilience and an effectively functioning supply chain.  
The aim is to try to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from farming. 
Agriculture as a sector is the largest emitter in Northern Ireland.  
Among the proposals are a reduction in the age at which cattle would go to slaughter, a ""farming for nature"" package and a ""farming for carbon"" package. 
""Farming for Nature"" is expected to form a central plank of agricultural support, over time.  
Its main focus will be on improving biodiversity on farms, through measures like hedgerows, integration of trees within crops and livestock farming, and protected areas.  
The ""Farming for Carbon"" strand aims to reduce the carbon footprint of the agricultural industry through a number of proposals, including reducing the number of older cattle for slaughter, improved genetics, and feed additives.  
The agriculture minister said designing the policy was ""a unique opportunity"" to redefine agricultural policy.
Edwin Poots also said it was a chance to ""target support to meet local priorities and needs much more effectively"".
""As we build out this future portfolio, I want to ensure that farmers are supported and equipped with the right tools to continue producing high quality, nutritious food whilst importantly, also reducing their environmental impact,"" he added.
The consultation is open until 15 February 2022, with early findings to be published early in the year.

2,3,Climate change,Jesse Preyser,Miners experiment with hydrogen to power giant trucks,2021-12-21,http://www.bbc.com//news/business-59576867,"Mining trucks are monstrous machines that guzzle fuel at a scarcely believable rate.
Weighing 220 tonnes, they can get through 134 litres of diesel every hour. 
Little wonder then that mining companies are focusing their attention on these vehicles as the first step to reducing their carbon footprint.
Anglo American, in collaboration with several partners, is retrofitting a mining haul truck with hydrogen power technology.
A first of its kind, the monster mining vehicle is being piloted in Limpopo, South Africa, at the firm's Mogalakwena platinum mine. 
Due to be launched in early 2022, the truck will be hybrid, with a hydrogen fuel cell providing roughly half of the power and a battery pack the other half. 
Instead of having a tank of diesel that powers the motor, hydrogen enters the fuel cell and mixes with oxygen to create water in a chemical reaction catalysed by platinum, which generates the electricity needed to power the motors that drive the wheels.
It only emits water vapour and the company says it has the potential to reduce on-site diesel emissions by up to 80%.
By rolling out this technology across its global truck fleet, Anglo American says it will be ""taking the equivalent of half a million diesel cars off the road"". 
The trucks also harvest regenerative energy created when driving downhill and braking, which is stored in the battery and extends the range of the vehicle.
Anglo is developing the truck along with partners Engie, NPROXX, First Mode, Williams Advanced Engineering, Ballard, ABB, Nel and Plug Power.
However, reducing the carbon footprint of the mining industry is a formidable task.
The construction sector, which includes mining, accounted for 36% of global final energy use and 39% of energy-related CO2 emissions in 2017, according to Davide Sabbadin, senior policy officer for climate and circular economy at the European Environmental Bureau (EEB).
He says the sector will need to reduce its energy consumption by a third if it hopes to be compatible with the Paris Agreement.
Hydrogen-powered trucks are a good start but need closer inspection, says Diego Marin, associate policy officer for environmental justice at the EEB. 
""While electric-powered vehicles, generally speaking, are less damaging to the environment than internal combustion engines on a life cycle analysis, this does not mean that they are green,"" he says.
Mr Marin points out it all hinges on how the hydrogen is produced. Some hydrogen is created using fossil fuels, which of course means there are substantial emissions as a result.
Anglo American says it is pulling out all the stops in an attempt to attain carbon neutrality by 2040.
Its hydrogen-powered hauler uses green hydrogen, which is made by splitting water atoms into oxygen and hydrogen, through electrolysis.
Even that is treated with caution by the EEB. 
""We should refrain from presenting hydrogen as a technological solution to all problemsâ¦ all forms of hydrogen come at an environmental cost - water use, impacts on nature,"" says Mr Sabbadin. 
The EEB also points out that hydrogen power has a shorter storage life than other renewables and is substantially more expensive to produce.  
More technology of business:
Whether it be investment for the mining industry's green goals or hydrogen power as a broader power solution, the issue of cost is definitely a pertinent one in South Africa. 
Jarrad Wright, an energy consultant and principal engineer for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) explains. 
""Hydrogen for power production is still quite expensive and unlikely to compete for some time."" 
This is largely due to a lack of supporting infrastructure for the new forms of energy to be created, distributed or stored. 
But, Mr Wright adds that it is possible to migrate to hydrogen in specific applications. 
At the moment South Africa's hydrogen power infrastructure is still sparse.
But the government and private partners are exploring ways to transform the country's platinum belt into a ""hydrogen valley"", with a focus on producing green hydrogen.
Anglo American is one of the private partners in this hydrogen infrastructure plan, which aims to create a regional renewable energy ecosystem. 
The starting point for this ecosystem is due to be built at the Mogalakwena mine itself, through the construction of a hydrogen production and storage complex. It incorporates the largest electrolyser in Africa, a solar power field, and will generate approximately 140MW of green power. 
Initially, it will be to support the 24-hour operation of the new truck, but once operational, the aim is for numerous complexes such as this one, to serve as local and regional hubs for the emerging hydrogen economy.
""The ecosystem would not only help us reduce our... emissions, but would also provide the foundation for green hydrogen production, facilitating the roll-out of hydrogen-powered haul trucks across South Africa,"" Anglo says.

3,4,Budget 2021,BBC News,Welsh budget: Bumper funding rise for Welsh NHS amid backlog,2021-12-20,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-wales-politics-59720795,"NHS spending in Wales will jump next year to tackle record high waiting times created by Covid.
An extra Â£893m will be pumped in during 2022, as part of the Â£24.6bn Welsh government budget.
More cash has also been promised for councils, and Labour Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said the budget will help make Wales ""a fairer nation"".
Welsh Conservatives said the budget had been made possible after record funding from the UK government.
Shops and hospitality will get a 50% cut to business rates - a relief to some firms waiting to hear if there would be any help for the tax from April.
Plaid Cymru said the spending plans will deliver a ""stronger"" Wales, following the party's co-operation agreement with Welsh Labour ministers.
The Welsh government say that over three years it will provide Â£1.3bn in extra direct funding to the Welsh NHS.
Most of that - Â£893m - will arrive in the first financial year. That is a 10.7% increase on the current budget, or 7.8% when inflation is taken into account, with smaller increases in later years.
Numbers waiting for treatments hit record levels last August.
Budget documents say the government's ""highest priority is to address the backlog of treatments that have been delayed by the pandemic"".
Helen Whyley of the Royal College of Nurses said a significant portion has to be spent on NHS salaries, with 1,719 vacancies in Wales.
The union is currently in dispute with the Welsh government over pay.
""You can have all the money in the world for services,"" Ms Whyley said. ""But if you don't have the staff to care for patients, and to deliver that care safely, it won't buy you anything.""
Despite the rise in day-to-day spending, funding for health care facilities will fall from Â£377m to Â£279m next year.
The Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents health organisations, said its ""members are disappointed in the lack of investment in capital infrastructure to improve and redesign NHS estates and facilities"".
Cardiff University's Guto Ifan said the planned increase for NHS spending in Wales appears to be ""slightly below"" extra cash for Wales triggered because of NHS spending in England.
""There are huge uncertainties about the medium-term impact of the pandemic and these spending plans could well need to be revised upwards in later years.""
Council funding will increase by Â£384m to Â£5.1bn - 8.1% in nominal terms or 5.2% when inflation is taken into account.
Officials say this is the largest increase to the cash for local government - which is spent on social care and other services - since devolution began.
Mr Ifan said councils should be able to meet their spending needs next year ""with relatively low increases in council tax"".
The announcement follows a promise of more cash for Welsh public services from the Treasury, which provides the lion's share of the Welsh government's money.
Experts at Cardiff University say Â£2.9bn will be available to spend by 2024.
It also comes after an agreement between the Welsh government and Plaid Cymru which included free school meals over three years and expanding free childcare to two-year-olds.
Both were included in the budget, with Â£30m for early years and childcare, and Â£90m for free school meals over three years.
According to the Welsh government, businesses in retail, leisure and hospitality will receive 50% rates relief for 2022-23, matching similar plans announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak for England.
It will be less than the 100% discount many such firms receive now. The scheme will be capped at Â£110,000 per business.
With other relief schemes ministers say 85,000 properties will be supported, while a further Â£35m will be spent to freeze rates for 2022-23.
Despite the announcement, Michael Manghan and Rhian Davies, who run the Crown and Sceptre in Cadoxton, Neath, are still concerned for what 2022 will hold.
Ms Davies feared the rate bill they would now need to pay was a ""big chunk of money to find"".
She said she would have like to have seen more, but added: ""It's better than nothing.""
Mr Manghan said: ""The money we've lost over the last year - we're only just coming back to repay people.""
Sam Dabb, who runs Le Pub in Newport, was pleased to hear the news. ""It's one of the main costs of the business, it's absolutely massive.""
One businessman said the Welsh government definitely had to meet the 50% cut introduced in England, and warned next year could be tough.
The Vale Resort in Hensol, Vale of Glamorgan, is starting to recover after a difficult 21 months. 
Bookings have increased since Covid restrictions were lifted and the company has opened a distillery on site to expand the business. 
Its managing director, Stephen Leeke, said government support schemes such as furlough, business rate relief and the Economic Resilience Fund (ERF) had helped the company stay afloat. 
He said: ""There's certainly an argument to say that they might consider going further, because I think we are in for a bit of a roller coaster now in the next couple of months and I don't think there's any doubt the industry will need some support.""
The Welsh government said it would spend Â£1.8bn on investments in its climate change department over three years, which includes Â£1.6bn on housing.
Of that, Â£1bn will be spent on housing and Â£375m for building safety.
Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said the Welsh government was still operating in a ""difficult financial context with our budget nearly Â£3bn lower than if it had increased in line with the economy since 2010-11"".
""This budget will support the Wales of today and shape the Wales of tomorrow. It will support our public services to be stronger, put Wales further down the path to being a net zero nation, and create a fairer nation with equality at its heart,"" she said.
Welsh Conservative finance spokesman Peter Fox said: ""Today's budget has been made possible by the Conservative government delivering record funding for Wales.
""In that light, I welcome the much-needed business rates holiday to help firms recover from the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, along with an important uplift in funding for our local authorities who deliver so many key services in communities across Wales.""
Llyr Gruffydd, Plaid Cymru finance spokesperson, said: ""Thanks to Plaid Cymru, this budget will deliver an even fairer, even greener, even stronger Wales through ambitious policy pledges.
""From free school meals for all primary pupils to extending free childcare to all two-year olds and much more, the commitments secured by Plaid Cymru as part of the co-operation agreement with Welsh government will secure transformational support for some of our poorest households and will change people's lives for the better across Wales.""
There will be relief among the many thousands working in hospitality, retail and leisure across Wales.
The Welsh government has matched what is happening in England and business rates for those industries will be halved. Most of them will still struggle to pay that as the pandemic continues to play havoc with trade with fewer people out shopping.
With a new Welsh government department focused on climate change, it's hardly surprising that it's getting more money. What is interesting, and tells us about the departments priorities, is that of the Â£1.8bn for capital spending by the climate change minister almost all of it (Â£1.6bn) is to improve the quality and supply of housing.   
This budget is taking the long term view even though the immediate economic landscape is extremely fragile.

4,5,Climate change,BBC News,Calls for 'reasoned debate' over oil and gas future,2021-12-19,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-59717784,"Business leaders have written a joint open letter to party leaders calling for a ""reasoned debate"" over the future of oil and gas in the UK.
The call comes after plans for the controversial Cambo Oil field off Shetland were put on hold. 
The letter says any statements calling for an end to new exploration have shaken investor confidence, placing tens of thousands of jobs at risk.
It warns politicians against creating a ""hostile investment environment"".
The letter, from Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce, supported by The British Chambers of Commerce and Scottish Chambers of Commerce, has also been signed by 58 leading figures from business and civic life in Aberdeen.
It says the economic wellbeing of whole communities across the UK is also being put at risk.
The letter adds that the statements calling for an end to new exploration ""threaten the very basis of a fair and inclusive transition at the most crucial point in our collective journey to a net-zero society"". 
""A transition, by definition, is a change of state over time,"" it says. ""This is one of the most complex challenges we have faced in our history and it doesn't lend itself to a simple, 'Who's good, who's bad? Who's green, who's not?' approach. To characterise it in this way is overly simplistic. 
""We must now pause and allow for a reasoned debate about our energy future to take place. At the same time, we urge politicians to reflect carefully on their public statements on oil and gas and the impact they have on investment in the industry.
""We must not create an adverse policy environment at this crucial moment in our energy transition journey.""
The letter adds that by 2050, the International Energy Agency projects that global oil and gas demand will fall by 80%, but 20 million barrels per day will still be needed. 
""Therefore, there is no current future scenario where there is not a requirement for some oil and gas,"" it says. ""Meantime, it continues to be required for people to travel, heat and power their homes and for the manufacture of many everyday goods."" 
""This leaves us with two options; to produce this domestically, with full control over the regulatory environment in which it is extracted; or to import an increasing amount of our energy, with the heavier carbon toll that shipping it from other parts of the world carries. The latter makes little economic sense, and even less environmental sense.""
Russell Borthwick, chief executive of Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: ""We have a shared interest in getting to net zero as quickly as possible, but over recent months our region has been portrayed as part of the problem rather than part of the solution.
""The reality is that the skills, people, and experience embedded in the north-east of Scotland have quietly been leading the way in moving the UK towards its net-zero targets, without any intervention from COP26. 
""However, turning the North Sea into a hostile investment environment today does nothing to support that transition. In fact, it does the opposite, driving investment and tens of thousands of jobs away to other regions of the world.""
He added that the energy-transition opportunity for Aberdeen could be bigger than the oil and gas industry - but to get there, strong leaders were needed who were willing to ""cut through the noise, see the big picture and get our transition steps in the right order to protect jobs, provide retraining opportunities and create new ones"".
Deirdre Michie, chief executive of OGUK, which represents the UK's offshore oil and gas industry, said: ""Right now, we need oil and gas for 73% of our total energy, and so the transition to carbon neutrality will be a huge and complex task.  
""We will only be able to achieve it with careful planning by policy-makers who think long-term to develop clear government policies that are then supported by all politicians working together in the national interest. ""
She said that for years to come, oil and gas needed to be part of the energy mix. 
""It will be far better for the nation and the environment if we source these fuels from around our shores rather than relying on even more imports,""  she added.

5,6,Climate change,BBC News,Bangor's Hirael sea defences 'in various states of disrepair',2021-12-18,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-wales-59709880,"Plans have been drawn up to build 600m (1,970ft) of new defences to protect properties from floods and rising sea levels.
Existing defences are ""in various states of disrepair"" at Hirael, in Bangor, a report submitted to Gwynedd Council has said.
The sea level is projected to rise 1.2m (3.9ft) by the end of this century, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. 
The area has previously been hit by severe flooding in 1923 and 1973.
Parts of Bangor have been identified as being at risk of flooding due to climate change.
The low-lying Hirael area faces a combination of factors, including an expected rise in sea levels and flooding the river Adda, as it empties into the sea. 
The plans at Beach Road showed the wall would be raised 1.3m (4ft 3in) above the existing level of the seafront promenade. Other plans include:
Designed by Ymgynghoriaeth Gwynedd Consultancy, the supporting documents said: ""The existing coastal defences at Hirael are limited with the only formal defences in the area being a sea wall which in various states of disrepair, a revetment and gabion baskets at the coastal frontage, north east of Beach Road. 
""Currently, there are no other structures that manage wave overtopping and inundation. 
""Temporary flood barriers such as sandbags have been deployed in the past along the length of the sea wall and two slipways to deal with high tides and wave surges but are not a sufficient source of long-term flood protection.""
It is expected that Gwynedd Council's planning department will consider the application in the coming months.

6,7,Climate change,Becky Morton,Climate change: How can renters make their homes warmer and greener?,2021-12-18,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-59223081,"Making the UK's ageing housing more energy efficient will be key to the country reaching its climate targets - but campaign groups representing renters and landlords say more action is needed to drive improvements.
""At one point you could see your breath in the living room it was that cold,"" says Erin Davy. 
The 29-year-old was renting a two-bedroom flat in Melbourn, Cambridgeshire. 
The letting agent had given an estimate of around Â£80 a month for the electricity bill. But when she moved in, her direct debit ended up being just under Â£200 a month - and over winter her monthly bill soared to as much as Â£400 a month. 
""Privately renting now is so expensive for young people as it is. Just the rent, let alone having a massive energy bill on top of it,"" she says. ""It was crippling."" 
Erin's boyfriend had lost his job at the beginning of the pandemic so the couple were relying on her wage alone to pay the bills - and she had to increase her overdraft to cover it. 
The ballooning costs meant they had to be careful about when to turn the heating on and rarely used the living room because it was so difficult to heat. 
After asking their landlord to take action he replaced their old storage heaters with newer models - but it didn't help. The problem was the flat didn't seem to stay warm at all. 
As a converted outhouse, the building was badly insulated, especially the floors and walls. 
Poor insulation doesn't just mean higher bills for renters - it also has an impact on the environment. Heating buildings contributes to almost a quarter of all UK emissions and the more heat that escapes through walls and roofs, the more energy is wasted. 
For Erin, things got so bad that she asked for an inspection by the council's environmental health team who found the inadequate heating was a health and safety hazard. 
But the more she asked their landlord to make improvements, she says, the less responsive he became. Eventually the landlord served them with an eviction notice, saying he wanted the flat back for his own use. 
Erin says the experience of being evicted was ""horrible"" but they managed to find somewhere else to live. 
""We couldn't have stayed there - we couldn't afford it,"" she says. ""I couldn't have done another winter in a freezing cold house.""
If you think your energy bills are too high or your home isn't staying warm, the first thing to do is check its energy performance certificate (EPC) online, says Dan Wilson Craw, from campaign group Generation Rent. 
Buildings are graded between A - the most energy efficient - and G. In England and Wales, homes must have a rating of at least E to be rented out, with only limited exemptions. The government has also consulted on raising the minimum standard to band C. 
In Scotland, the government plans to require privately rented properties to have a rating of at least C from 2025. 
Damp or mould is another sign that your home may be poorly insulated. 
There is government advice available online on how to make your home more energy efficient, which Mr Craw advises renters look at before approaching their landlord. 
But if landlords refuse to take action you can ask the local council to carry out an inspection. Councils are responsible for enforcing health and safety standards of homes and if they find serious issues with damp or heating, they can force the landlord to make improvements. 
Mr Craw says there are also grants and funding available through some councils and energy companies to help make your home more energy efficient if you're on a low income. 
However, research by Generation Rent suggests many renters are reluctant to demand or invest in improvements because they are unsure whether they will live in a home long enough to benefit from the cheaper bills. 
Others may be worried that if their landlord does pay for improvements, they may increase the rent to recoup costs or even evict them. 
Mr Craw says government plans to abolish section 21 ""no fault"" evictions, which would prevent landlords evicting tenants without good reason, will help give renters more certainty about how long they will be living somewhere. 
Generation Rent also supports raising minimum energy efficiency standards for rented homes - and wants tenants to be able to claim back rent if landlords break the rules. 
And the group wants to limit the amount landlords can increase rent for existing tenants to wage inflation, to avoid them upping the rent if they are forced to pay for improvements. 
For landlords, the main barrier to making improvements is cost, according to Chris Norris, from the National Residential Landlords Association. 
Nearly one in five households in England live in the private rented sector, but this type of housing tends to be older and more difficult to insulate. 
The average cost of bringing a privately rented home up to EPC C standard is Â£7,646, according to the government. 
And while landlords must pay for any changes to their property, they generally don't see the benefits of lower bills. 
Mr Norris says the grants available are quite limited. 
The government recently announced grants of Â£5,000 would be available to people in England and Wales from next April to replace their gas boilers with low-carbon heat pumps, to help cut greenhouse gas emissions. 
But heat pumps can cost between Â£6,000 and Â£18,000 - not including any expensive new insulation that may also be needed - so the subsidy would not cover the total cost. 
As well as more generous grants, the association also wants to see tax deducted from spending on energy efficiency to give landlords an extra financial incentive. 
With gas prices surging, Mr Craw says making homes more energy efficient is even more urgent. 
""If you could address it, you can improve standards of life for private renters and cut carbon emissions,"" he says. ""But it requires action from the government to do that.""

8,9,Storm Dennis,Matthew Murray,Climate change: Young activists snub award,2021-12-17,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-wales-59690009,"Young members of an environmental group have turned down an award from a council, accusing it of not doing enough to tackle climate change.
Pontypridd's Young Friends of the Earth has been campaigning for changes to address the climate emergency. 
It said Rhondda Cynon Taf council has not done enough since the devastating floods in 2020 after Storm Dennis. 
Group member Alice, 13, said: ""It would be hypocritical for us to take the award.""
""We feel Rhondda Cynon Taf council - and the world - isn't taking action against climate change,"" she added. 
""The major changes we could do as a county would be big decisions and not small day-to-day ones. 
""Because if you sit in a house which is on fire you wouldn't just sit there as the flames surrounded you and start making a plan how you're going to deal with the fire.
""You're going to act immediately and get water and you're going to put the fire out. You wouldn't sit there doing nothing. The world isn't in the best shape and they're not doing enough about it.""
Alice added that there was ""action immediately"" when the pandemic hit, and the same needed to be done for the climate change emergency.
""We need that with climate change because if we don't get it sorted out we might not be here.""
When Storm Dennis caused widespread flooding across south Wales in February 2020, Pontypridd was one of the worst affected towns. 
Homes and businesses were hit, with the middle of the town centre flooded after the River Taff burst its banks. 
""When we saw the town flood last year we knew climate change was getting worse and despite what people were saying about it getting better because it's not,"" said Alice. 
""I felt terrified when I saw water running down the main street because if water can reach that high because of a storm, imagine what it will be like in 10 years.""
Dan, 12, another member of Young Friends of the Earth, said: ""I would have expected Rhondda Cynon Taf council to declare a climate emergency after the Welsh government did. 
""They are one of the few councils in Wales not to declare it and after Storm Dennis I'd have thought it would have been the first thing they would have done. 
""I fear, with the melting ice caps, much of the Welsh coast and RCT will get completely flooded and we'll lose whole towns and people's homes. So we need to take action so we don't lose all the history too.""
Rowan, 10, said they thought it would generate more publicity to turn down the award than accept it.
""I don't think people understand how bad things are. I find it traumatising, when I think to the future.
""I might have a future with crumbling mountains and suffocating air, and I don't want that to happen.""
Council leader Andrew Morgan replied to a letter from the group declining the award, saying the council is committed to achieving net zero by 2030 and ""has already made progress towards achieving this commitment to meet and contribute to global, national and local targets"".

9,10,Climate change,BBC News,Preston's City's carbon neutral aim poses 'financial challenge',2021-12-17,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-england-lancashire-59696406,"A city council's aim to become carbon neutral by 2030 poses a financial challenge, a report has found.
A cross-party task group has spent almost two years exploring what Preston City Council needs to do to fulfil the pledge made in April 2019.
The report said decisions would have to be taken ensure ""the greatest carbon reduction can be achieved at the earliest opportunity"".
But its fleet of 124 vehicles will remain diesel-driven.
Councillors voted for the authority to invest a further Â£4.8m over the next five years in replacing the vehicles, but an accompanying report said it was not currently possible to purchase ""alternative fuelled"" vehicles, because of the lack of the necessary infrastructure to operate them.
Environment and community safety cabinet member Robert Boswell defended the decision not to shift the fleet to electric at this point, warning that if the council had to charge all of its vehicles ""there might be power failures in Preston, because there [are] other factors [to consider]"".
He suggested that the authority faced the same practical barriers to electric vehicles that were experienced by some members of the public, including a lack of charging points.
""The new vehicles that we will be moving to, though not electronic vehicles, have a reduction in emissions and have potential [for] fuel savings and more efficient engines,"" he said.
Liberal Democrat group leader John Potter branded the report ""disappointing"" and said the council would not achieve its carbon-cutting aims.
However, the Labour chair of the task group, James Hull, said it demonstrated that the authority would have a ""robust climate change agenda"" at the forefront of all its work.
The main recommendation - to create a cabinet member responsible for tackling climate change - has already been implemented by the Labour-run council back in the summer, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
The task group report noted the need for the council to focus on its own carbon emissions, other local emissions that it can directly influence through its policies and community emissions that can be cut through partnerships between the council and other organisations.
It also suggested that the council carries out a study to explore whether it is feasible to maximise heat recovery at the city's crematorium in order to make it more energy efficient.

10,11,COP26,Steffan Messenger,Climate change: Wales COP26 events 'costly failure',2021-12-16,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-wales-59670318,"A series of events held in Wales to coincide with the COP26 climate summit has been branded a costly ""failure"" by the Welsh Conservatives.
Figures obtained by the party show the Welsh government spent Â£235,000 on COP Cymru.
But the Tories claim the programme of debates and lectures resulted in little public or media interest.
The Welsh government said more than 3,800 people had attended the events online.
The series started days before the summit in Glasgow with the launch of the Welsh government's Net Zero plan - with a panel session in Port Talbot streamed live to a virtual audience.
A roadshow followed during COP26 itself- with four debate and discussion events held in different parts of Wales looking at energy, nature, climate change adaptation and transport.
This was followed by a Wales Climate Week at the end of November - a five-day programme of virtual events.  
A breakdown of the costs involved provided by the Welsh government show Â£53,600 was spent on staging and sound requirements, up to Â£135,000 on staffing and event management, Â£9,500 on a COP Cymru online platform, up to Â£23,000 on press and marketing, with about Â£13,490 on other costs.
Well-known Welsh presenters and journalists were invited to chair the discussions, which featured leading experts in environmental issues, as well as government ministers.
Recordings of each session have been posted online - while viewing figures are not visible, all of the videos bar one have yet to receive a single comment or ""like"".
The Tories alleged that COP Cymru had been used for ""rhetoric not action"" and had resulted in ""little to no new policy"" announcements beyond the initial Net Zero plan.  
Their climate change spokesperson in the Senedd, Janet Finch-Saunders MS said the whole thing had been a ""failure"".
""It's highly disappointing that hard earned taxpayer money was spent on events that were little more than self-promotion and ego stroking,"" she said. 
She claimed funding had been ""frittered away"" and that it would have been better spent on shoring up coal tips, which was ""such a priority for the people of Wales"".
But climate scientist Professor Mary Gagen of Swansea University said aspects of the criticism had ""made her blood boil"".
She was involved in several COP Cymru events, as well as producing a guide for Welsh schools on climate change and videos showcasing the efforts of university researchers in the field.
""What I thought was a real shame was saying that, because these weren't flashy media events that they weren't inspiring and weren't able to make a difference,"" she said.
""It's the exact opposite - what leads to positive change are those little moments where a school child is able to meet with a scientist, where a farmer is able to ask a question, they're never going to make the front page but they're really meaningful.
""For me COP Cymru generated thousands and thousands of those moments.""
Dr Anna Bullen of the Centre for Alternative Technology who also chaired one of the events said the livestreaming element made it ""hard to gauge"" how they were being received.
""Of course I want to see as much public engagement as possible but I wouldn't use that as a sole reason to end an event like this.""
""For our sector bringing together practitioners and experts, sharing views, understanding and research is so important,"" she said.
A spokesperson for the Welsh government said COP Cymru included an extensive programme of events, attracting more than 3,800 virtual attendees, 200 speakers and 38 sessions.
""Several fringe events were also held as there was too much demand for content to fit into a single programme,"" they said.
He added that if the government was to meet its net zero targets it was ""crucial we engage with people, businesses and organisations across Wales"".
""COP26 provided an international platform to show Wales is playing its part in tackling the threats of climate change and that we are listening and learning from experiences elsewhere,"" they said.
""COP Cymru brought the conversation closer to home and was an important opportunity to engage citizens across Wales, helping them understand the need for collective action and the role they can play."" 
On coal tip safety, he added it was the UK Government that was ""unwilling to take responsibility"" for the restoration work costs, currently estimated to be at least Â£500m.

11,12,COP26,Kayleen Devlin,The teenagers and the nun trying to stop an Australian coal mine,2021-12-15,http://www.bbc.com//news/world-australia-59390798,"When eight teenagers and an elderly nun in Australia teamed up for a climate case, they won, in a historic judgement. Their case has now been appealed by the country's government. If the final verdict swings in their favour, it will have ramifications not just for Australian law but for climate cases world-wide. 
In May this year, Anjali Sharma was sitting in her economics class at school in Melbourne when the court in Sydney live-streamed the results of a climate case she had found herself at the centre of. It took a while to sink in. 
""To me it all just sounded like jargon. It took a briefing from my legal team to understand the magnitude of what had happened,"" she says. 
At that moment 17-year-old Ms Sharma and the seven other teenagers involved in her case had made history. Alongside 87-year-old Catholic nun Brigid Arthur, who acted as the young people's legal guardian, they'd taken Australia's environment minister, Sussan Ley, to court - and won.
""It felt really rewarding to be able to engage in something so historic for Australia, and needed too,"" says Ms Sharma.
Their case attempted to stop the expansion of the Vickery coal mine in New South Wales, which is estimated to add an extra 170 million tonnes of fossil fuel emissions to the atmosphere. 
The judge in their case, Mordy Bromberg, ruled that the government had a duty to protect young people against future harm related to climate change. It's the first time in the world that a duty of care of this kind has been recognised.
Justice Bromberg did not, however, grant them an injunction to prevent the expansion of the mine. In his view, the court didn't have any evidence that Sussan Ley would actually approve the extension, and any injunction would be pre-emptive.
Yet in September Ms Ley approved the extension of the Vickery coal mine, as well as three others since then. The government is also appealing the decision in the Sharma case - the outcome of which is due soon.
The government used a ""substitution argument"" as one reason to approve Vickery, says the lawyer representing the Sharma case, David Barnden.
""It's the argument that if this particular coal project didn't go ahead, it wouldn't make a difference to the total amount of emissions because effectively the market would fulfill that demand. That's otherwise known as the drug dealer's defence - it's the idea that 'If I don't deal drugs then somebody else will.'""
For Sister Brigid Arthur, the minister's decisions since the success of their case are ""quite provocative"".
Sister Arthur has spent a lifetime working with young people. For over two decades she has been acting as a litigation guardian - instructing lawyers on behalf of those who can't represent themselves - in cases mostly involving refugees. Before that she was a secondary school teacher. This is her first environmental case. 
""It's engaged young people in a way that seems quite extraordinary. It's certainly for me something new,"" she says.
She was approached by lawyers just over a year ago who asked her to act as the teenagers' litigation guardian. She didn't take much convincing.
""I'm pretty passionate about climate change and while I don't work directly in this area, I'm very conscious of the fact that it's important for people to do what they can.
""Young people are the ones who will inherit whatever we're doing now, so they have every right to be calling people to account.""
In speaking out, Ms Sharma has made herself a target for attacks.
""I've been messaged a lot of threats,"" she says.
""Some of the big news sources in Australia have, I guess, quite a right-wing following, so when news sources like that have covered my story I learned really quickly not to read the comments.""
A 2019 report which investigated four publications owned by Australia's most powerful media company, News Corp Australia, argued that they promoted climate scepticism. Of over 8,000 articles analysed, 45% of all items either rejected or cast doubt upon consensus scientific findings.
In response, a News Corp Australia spokesman said the year-old report was ""imbalanced"" and coming from ""a political activist group with a history of bias against our company's journalism"".
News Corp Australia recently has been viewed as softening its hostility towards climate action by advocating for net zero emissions by 2050.
Despite this, shortly before and during COP26, videos from News Corp-owned Sky News Australia were recycled and found traction on social media amongst climate sceptics.
One Sky News Australia segment in which the host condemns youth climate activists as ""selfish, badly educated, virtue-signalling little turds"" was shared by the head of the advocacy group the CO2 coalition and received over 45,000 likes and 16,000 retweets.
As the science of climate change has become harder to argue with, a growing and common tactic is often to shoot the messenger instead - often accusing them of hypocrisy. 
""Comments like 'Oh, she's wearing jeans and I bet she doesn't know how much water goes into producing a pair of jeans,'"" says Ms Sharma. ""And you know, they're right. I do own a pair of jeans. But me not owning that pair of jeans is not going to cut Australia's emissions in half by 2030.""

When Sister Brigid first met the teenagers, who knew each other through attending climate protests, she was struck by their passion. She describes them as a group of young people ""who really believe in this, who feel like they can't stop"".
""There are very few greys with young people,"" she says. ""Everything is so black and white.""
But for now, all they can do is wait for the result of the appeal to be announced.
Despite widespread recognition of the need to move away from coal, there are different approaches when it comes to putting that knowledge into practice. At the COP26 summit in Glasgow, coal became a point of contention after delegates from China and India requested a last-minute change to the agreement, switching the phrase ""phase out"" coal with ""phase down"".
The results of the appeal and their case could be game-changing - not only for Australia but for other parts of the world too.
A success in their case could signal an erosion in support for fossil fuel burning and extraction with more lawsuits of this kind ahead. But if the minister's appeal is successful, it could see courts effectively vacate the climate field.
Australia is the world's second-largest exporter of coal. Following the Glasgow summit, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the coal industry will be operating in the country for ""decades to come"". He added that the plan to achieve net zero by 2050 will not come at the cost of rural and regional Australians. 
""The world is grappling with this collective action problem of climate change. Every mine has its part to play and every decision counts,"" says Mr Barnden.
""What the court found was that the emissions from this particular extension project could be the emissions that tip us over the edge to these nonlinear tipping points which would further accelerate climate change.""
He hopes that the duty of care ruling - if maintained through the appeal process - can influence other jurisdictions and give hope to young people to be able to participate in the legal process.
""It's a very foundational legal case to approach the problems caused by climate change, and the principles of negligence exist in a whole range of common law countries, from the UK, to New Zealand, Canada and the US as well.""
It's too soon to tell whether this case will provide a turning point on climate inaction. But for Ms Sharma and the other teenagers involved in her case, the time for action is now.
""I really hope the federal court realises that Australia is now running behind the rest of the world, and that the duty of care that my case seeks to establish is really, really needed right now.""
