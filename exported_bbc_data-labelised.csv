0,Climate change,Tom Espiner,Major investor will target bosses at firms failing on climate,2022-01-23,"A major UK investment fund has said it will vote to try to get directors kicked out of firms that fail to make good on environmental pledges.
Aviva Investors also wants bosses' pay to be linked to sustainability goals.
It is the latest big investment firm to ramp up the pressure on corporations in a bid to make them clean up their acts.
BlackRock, the world's largest fund, has told the firms it invests in to step up on sustainability or face the consequences.
Aviva Investors, which has Â£262bn of assets under management, set out its expectations in a letter that will be sent to 1,500 firms in 30 countries this week.
The fund said it had broadened its definition of sustainability and would now focus on issues such as biodiversity and human rights, alongside existing priorities like climate change and executive pay.
""We will hold boards and individual directors accountable where the pace of change does not reflect the urgency required,"" said the annual letter from Aviva Investors boss Mark Versey.
Mr Versey said there had been an ""alarming"" 68% decrease in animal and plant species between 1970 and 2016.
""This is of serious concern as ecosystem services provided by the natural world underpin our economies and societies and will increasingly become an important driver of company valuations,"" Mr Versey said, adding that more than half of the world's economic output is ""reliant on biodiversity"".
On human rights, Aviva expects companies it backs to scrutinise the impact they have when doing business, and to take action to stop harm.
Firms will need to give more detailed explanations of how they intend to meet environmental goals, it added.
Mirza Baig, Aviva Investors' head of environmental, social and corporate governance, told the BBC that some companies intentionally set vague targets to avoid being held to account. 
He said Aviva would increasingly use its vote as a shareholder to try to oust directors at firms that had a ""high impact"" on the planet but did little to rectify this.
The fund may also vote against executive pay deals if a firm is falling short, and as a last resort could withdraw its investment.
Last year 280 firms changed their practices after pressure from Aviva Investors, Mr Baig said. However, he urged more big investment firms to use their ""loud"" and ""influential"" voices to drive change.   
""If there was enough pressure being put on businesses then the world would look very different,"" he said.
Big investment funds are increasingly leaning on firms to make them change the way they do business.
Last week Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world's biggest investment fund, denied that the firm was being ""woke"" in calling for stronger climate policies from companies. 
Instead, he said the move made good business sense at a time when the public increasingly expects companies to behave ethically.
He insisted his firm was being capitalist in its outlook, adding: ""Make no mistake, the fair pursuit of profit is still what animates markets; and long-term profitability is the measure by which markets will ultimately determine your company's success.""

1,Our Planet Now,BBC News,'Surreal' January wildfire shuts California highway,2022-01-22,"An unseasonal wildfire is raging in California's Monterey County, forcing evacuations and the closure of Highway 1, US officials say.
The National Weather Service (NWS) reported a ""surreal fire behaviour given the wet Oct and Dec"". 
The blaze along the Big Sur Pacific coast, dubbed the Colorado Fire, has scorched about 1,500 acres (607 ha).
Strong winds pushed the fire toward the sea, and flames were seen burning near the famous Bixby Creek Bridge.
Senior forestry and fire protection official Mike Meddles said firefighters from 13 agencies from around California's central coast had been deployed to tackle the blaze, according to KTLA digital channel.
The area where the blaze is burning had ""little or no fire history,"" the NWS's Bay Area branch said in a Twitter post. .
""Anecdotally it seems as though the long term drought is acting like a chronic illness where even recent rains and cold winter weather isn't helping to keep fires from developing,"" the statement said.
Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.
The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

2,Tonga volcano and tsunami,athan Amos,Tonga volcano: Plume reached half-way to space,2022-01-22,"An indicator of the great power of last Saturday's volcanic eruption in Tonga is the height reached by its plume.
UK scientists examining weather satellite data calculate it to be around 55km (35 miles) above the Earth's surface.
This is at the boundary of the stratosphere and mesosphere layers in the atmosphere.
Dr Simon Proud, from RAL Space, said these were ""unheard-of altitudes"" for a volcanic plume.
The most powerful eruption in the second half of the 20th Century came from Mount Pinatubo in 1991. Its plume is thought to have climbed to roughly 40km.
However, it's possible today's more accurate satellites would have given a higher altitude for the Philippines event, cautioned Dr Proud, who is affiliated to the UK National Centre for Earth Observation.
To work out the position in the sky of the plume from Tonga's Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai volcano, data from three weather satellites - Himawari-8 (Japan) GOES-17 (USA) and GK2A (Korean) - was used.
""Because they're all at different longitudes, we can use the parallax between their views of the eruption to determine altitude. This is a pretty well established technique for storm cloud heights, and should actually work better here as the altitude [and hence parallax] is greater,"" Dr Proud told BBC News.
Only a small part of the cloud is seen to get to 55km. This is most likely water vapour, rather than ash, that was pushed upward at the head of the updraft. The main umbrella of the plume is at 35km. A lower plume feature is evident in the lowest layer of the atmosphere - the troposphere.
The so-called KÃ¡rmÃ¡n line, which is often quoted as the atmospheric boundary with outer space, is at 100km.
US space agency scientists calculated the explosive force to be equivalent to 10 megatons of TNT, which would have made the Tonga event 500 times as powerful as the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, at the end of World War Two. 
Prof Shane Cronin, from Auckland University, New Zealand, believes a special set of conditions came together at the underwater volcano to drive a big explosion.
A key factor, he said, was the depth below the ocean surface at which gas-rich magma came into contact with seawater - at just 150-250m.
""When the magma came out, there was not much pressure on it [from the water above],"" he told the BBC's Science In Action programme on World Service Radio.
""The gases expanded and blasted the magma apart. And then, as those little fragments of hot magma at 1,100 degrees encountered the cold seawater at 20 degrees, it flashed the seawater around those particles into steam. And when you do that, when you flash water into steam, you basically expand the volume by 70 times. So you supercharge your eruption.""  
Early data suggests the Tonga event could have measured as high as five on the volcanic explosivity index (VEI). This would certainly make it the most powerful eruption since Pinatubo, which was classified at six on the eight-point scale.
The Philippines volcano famously dropped Earth's average global temperature by half a degree for a couple of years. It did this by injecting 15 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere. SO2 combines with water to make a haze of tiny droplets, or aerosols, that reflect incoming solar radiation. 
However, Dr Richard Betts, the head of climate impacts at the UK Met Office, said Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai would not have the same effect.
""Pinatubo did have a noticeable effect, but the Hunga-Tonga volcano's emissions were more than 30 times smaller at less than half a million tonnes of sulphur dioxide, so we don't expect that to have a cooling effect, even though it made a huge bang when it went off,"" he explained.

3,Climate change,Helen Briggs,False banana: Is Ethiopia's enset 'wondercrop' for climate change?,2022-01-21,"Scientists say the plant enset, an Ethiopian staple, could be a new superfood and a lifesaver in the face of climate change.
The banana-like crop has the potential to feed more than 100 million people in a warming world, according to a new study.
The plant is almost unknown outside of Ethiopia, where it is used to make porridge and bread.
Research suggests the crop can be grown over a much larger range in Africa.
""This is a crop that can play a really important role in addressing food security and sustainable development,"" said Dr Wendawek Abebe of Hawassa University in Awasa, Ethiopia.
Enset or ""false banana"" is a close relative of the banana, but is consumed only in one part of Ethiopia.
The banana-like fruit of the plant is inedible, but the starchy stems and roots can be fermented and used to make porridge and bread.
Enset is a staple in Ethiopia, where around 20 million people rely on it for food, but elsewhere it has not been cultivated, although wild relatives - which are not considered edible - grow as far south as South Africa, suggesting the plant can tolerate a much wider range.
Using agricultural surveys and modelling work, scientists predicted the potential range of enset over the next four decades. They found the crop could potentially feed more than 100 million people and boost food security in Ethiopia and other African countries, including Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda.
Study researcher Dr James Borrell, of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said planting enset as a buffer crop for lean times could help boost food security.
""It's got some really unusual traits that make it absolutely unique as a crop,"" he said. ""You plant it at any time, you harvest it at any time and it's perennial. That's why they call it the tree against hunger.""
Ethiopia is a major centre of crop domestication in Africa, home to coffee and many other crops.
Climate change is predicted to seriously affect yields and distribution of staple food crops across Africa and beyond.
There is growing interest in seeking new plants to feed the world, given our reliance on a few staple crops. Nearly half of all the calories we eat come from three species - rice, wheat and maize.
""We need to diversify the plants we use globally as a species because all our eggs are in a very small basket at the moment,"" said Dr Borrell.
The research is published in Environmental Research Letters.

4,Climate change,BBC News,New transport blueprint unveiled for Scotland,2022-01-20,"A mass transit network in Glasgow and bridges or tunnels to some of Scotland's islands are among the ideas in the Scottish government's new transport strategy. 
Ministers have made 45 recommendations to guide transport investment decisions over the next 20 years.
Improving public transport links in the biggest city regions is at the heart of the blueprint.
Schemes to encourage more people to walk and cycle are also prioritised. 
The Scottish government hopes that shifting the priorities of transport spending to greener projects will help tackle climate emissions in the coming years. 
The strategy does not give timescales or funding commitments for its recommendations.
The ideas to be explored over the next two decades include: 
Michael Matheson, the cabinet secretary for transport, said: ""The investment decisions we make now have never been more important. 
""A green recovery from Covid-19 will set us on a path to delivering a fair and just transition to Net Zero. 
""This review represents a repositioning of our transport investment priorities - the focus is firmly on how transport can help us protect our climate and improve lives. It takes a balanced and fair approach to all modes of transport, and all areas of Scotland.""
The idea of a city-wide metro system in Glasgow was first proposed in 2019 and would involve reviving abandoned rail routes, converting heavy rail to light rail and developing on-street trams.
Scottish Labour and Glasgow MSP Pauline McNeill said: ""Today's announcement failed to provide answers on what the Glasgow metro project will look like, when work will begin and how the work will be funded. 
""Glasgow is in desperate need of investment to help it recover from the pandemic and make up for the chronic lack of investment over the last 15 years.""
A spokesman for Glasgow Airport said the new transit system would ""have a transformative effect in reducing carbon emissions, boosting public transport and alleviating congestion on the M8, one of Scotland's busiest sections of road.""
Colin Howden, director of the Transform Scotland lobby group, said: ""Scottish transport spending has in recent years been massively skewed towards high-carbon road-building. 
""So today's focus on active travel, decarbonised public transport and new light rail in the cities is a welcome change of course.""
On the proposed studies into bridges or tunnels for the Sound of Barra and Sound of Harris, Mr Howden added: ""I doubt any of these suggested crossings will ever be built. They look as improbable as Boris Johnson's failed Irish Sea Bridge proposal.""
Meanwhile, it has been revealed nearly Â£900,000 of taxpayers' money was spent on a study commissioned by Boris Johnson which found it would be too expensive to build a bridge or tunnel between Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The UK government Department for Transport said the research into the feasibility of a fixed link - which was later dismissed as ""impossible to justify"" - cost Â£896,681.

5,Climate change,BBC News,"Liverpool Council funding airport at odds with climate aims, councillor says",2022-01-20,"Liverpool's council must stop funding the city's airport because doing so is ""incompatible"" with its effort to fight climate change, a councillor has said.
In a motion to the Labour-led council, Green member Anna Key said supporting Liverpool John Lennon Airport (LJLA) was not in line with the authority's climate emergency declaration in 2019.
She also called for opposition to LJLA's ""potential future expansion"".
An airport spokesman said it had its own plans to be carbon neutral by 2040.
Liverpool City Council said it had a 10% stake in LJLA.
The Local Democracy Reporting Service said in her motion, St Michael's ward councillor Ms Key stated that since 2019 the authority had ""begun to develop policies which seek to address the negative impacts of climate change on the city"" and aimed to be carbon neutral by 2030.
She said LJLA's plan to expand its business by 2050 included a number of ""consequences"", such as an increased number of flights, reduced green space and a new road to carry freight and passenger traffic, which were ""incompatible with these aims and should be opposed"".
As a result, Ms Key said councillors should request that Mayor Joanne Anderson and the cabinet ""remove all financial support"" from LJLA and set out ""the council's opposition to its masterplan, which sets out the proposals for potential future expansion"".
The motion also calls on the council to get planners to ""undertake an urgent evidence-based review of all policies relating to green space and the environment... to ensure sufficient policy protections for green belt land are set"".
The motion will go before a full council meeting on 26 January.
An LJLA spokesman has previously said that while the timescale for its expansion plans were ""likely to slip"" as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, they remained ""valid"".
He said the airport ""naturally recognises its wider environmental responsibilities"" and had its own plans to reach net carbon zero by 2040, which include the installation of a solar farm to generate about a quarter of LJLA's annual energy needs.
The airport was also ""working with airlines, aircraft and engine manufacturers and others"" to create ""a roadmap for the wider aviation industry to be carbon neutral by 2050"", he added.

6,Climate change,Louise Cullen,Stormont energy plan 'will create jobs and lower bills',2022-01-20,"Northern Ireland's first energy strategy action plan has been published by the Department for the Economy.  
It outlines 22 actions for 2022, as the first step to reduce energy-related emissions by 56% by 2030.  
Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said it will create jobs and lead to lower costs for consumers.
About a third of the actions outlined in the plan aim to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.  
""We will take an energy efficiency-first approach which will help consumers reduce the energy they use and therefore minimise their energy bills,"" Mr Lyons said.
""The action plan maps out the best route to ensuring people will live and work in more energy efficient buildings, whilst helping some of the most vulnerable in society to live in warmer homes, reduce ill health and ultimately save lives.""
Energy - in the form of power, heating and transport - accounts for almost 60% of Northern Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.  
The actions outlined in the plans range from a geothermal project and studying the future role of biomethane, to low carbon heat technologies for homes and businesses.  
And there are detailed plans around the creation of a one-stop shop for consumers, where they can get advice and guidance on support to become more energy efficient and help reduce emissions. 
There is also a new Â£10m Green Innovation Challenge Fund which will be launched in April.  
Northern Ireland's energy strategy promised publication of an action plan early in the new year, and it's delivered 22 actions for 2022.  
If all, or even most, of those actions are achieved over the coming 12 months, the power picture in Northern Ireland will be starting to look different by this time next year.  
But there are some potential stumbling blocks along the way - first and foremost of course, is money.  
While the innovation fund, we're told, is ready to start from the beginning of the next tax year, other ideas will cost money.  
And the finance minister has already prioritised health.  
There is also the court of public opinion that will judge these actions - there is already opposition to gas storage, but hydrogen will need to be stored somehow, somewhere, when it's being produced in quantity.  
Overall, the actions outlined in the plan show the urgency of the work required over the next crucial decade, if Northern Ireland is to make any kind of dent in reducing its emissions by 2030.  
While the energy plan is being produced by the Department for the Economy, officials say almost every executive department will have a part to play.
Those roles include the Department for Communities in addressing fuel poverty, Infrastructure in supporting the expansion of the electric vehicle network and Department of Finance in providing the money. 
Meanwhile, NIE Networks has announced it will be creating at least 110 jobs, as part of a Â£50m investment in the electricity network.  
Recruitment has already started for some of the new posts, which include apprenticeships and graduate jobs as well.  
The additional funding was approved by the Utility Regulator, and will be focused on green energy over the next three years.  
That will cover the roll-out of new infrastructure to support customers who are moving to low-carbon technologies, like heat pumps for domestic heating and electric vehicles.  
Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, said the investment was in line with the aims of the energy strategy.
A target of generating 70% of power from renewable sources has been set for 2030.  
Almost half of Northern Ireland's electricity is already generated from renewable sources, mainly wind.  
""We need to do more of that,"" said Mr Stapleton.  
""We also need more solar but there's also newer solutions emerging, such as geothermal, tidal, off-shore wind. Hydrogen will have a role to play.
""And all of those technologies will be interdependent in some way with the electricity network, so we have a critical role to play to ensure all of those solutions can come together to form an integrated, sustainable energy system.""

7,Climate change,Beth Timmins & Daniel Thomas,Inflation: Seven reasons the cost of living is going up around the world,2022-01-20,"From buying groceries to heating our homes, the cost of living is rising sharply - not just in the UK but around the world. 
Global inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at its highest since 2008. Here are some of the reasons why.
Oil prices slumped at the start of the pandemic, but demand has rocketed back since, and have hit a seven-year high.
In the US gasoline currently costs an average of $3.31 a gallon - up from $2.39 a gallon a year ago. It's a similar story in the UK and the EU.
The price of gas has also shot up, leaving people around the world with eye-watering central heating bills. 
Demand from Asia has driven up prices, along with a cold winter in Europe last year, which depleted gas reserves. 
The price of many everyday consumer goods jumped during the pandemic. 
Consumers stuck at home during lockdown last year splashed out on household goods and home improvements because they couldn't go to restaurants or on holiday. 
Manufacturers in places such as Asia - many of which faced shutdowns due to Covid restrictions - have struggled to keep up with demand since then. 
It's led to shortages of materials such as plastic, concrete and steel, driving up prices. Timber cost as much as 80% more than usual in 2021 in the UK and reached more than twice its typical price in the US.  
Major US retailers Nike and Costco have put up their prices because of higher supply chain costs. 
And there's a shortage of microchips, which are vital components in cars, computers and other household goods. 
Global shipping companies - which move goods around the world - have been overwhelmed by surging demand after the pandemic.
It's meant retailers have had to pay a lot more to get those goods into stores. As a result, prices have been passed on to consumers.  
Sending a single 40ft container from Asia to Europe currently costs $17,000 (Â£12,480) - 10 times more than the year before, when it was $1,500 (Â£1,101).
It's been accompanied by a rise in air freight fees and made worse by a lorry driver shortage in Europe.
Transport bottlenecks appeared to be easing in December, with the US starting to get on top of record congestion at its ports. 
But Omicron and the emergence of future Covid variants could reverse these gains.
Many people quit the workforce or changed jobs during the pandemic. 
In the US, April saw more than four million people quit their jobs, according to the Department of Labor - the biggest spike on record.
As a result, firms are having problems recruiting staff such as drivers, food processors and restaurant waiters.
A survey of 50 major US retailers suggested 94% were having trouble filling empty roles.
As a result companies are having to put up wages or offer signing-on bonuses to attract and retain staff. McDonald's and Amazon are offering hiring bonuses ranging from $200 to $1,000.
Those extra employer costs are again being passed on to consumers. Global clothing brand Next have blamed planned price rises for 2022 partly on climbing wage costs.
Extreme weather in many parts of the world has contributed to inflation.
Global oil supplies took a hit from hurricanes Ida and Nicholas passing through the Gulf of Mexico and damaging US oil infrastructure. 
And problems meeting the demand for microchips were worsened after a fierce winter storm closed major factories in Texas last year. 
The cost of coffee has also jumped after Brazil, the world's largest producer, had a poor harvest following its most severe drought in almost a century.  
More costly imports are also contributing to higher prices. New post-Brexit trading rules are estimated to have reduced imports from the EU to the UK by about a quarter in the first half of 2021. 
Roaming charges are returning for many UK travellers visiting Europe this year. 
Separately, US import tariffs on Chinese goods have almost entirely been passed on to US customers in the form of higher prices. 
Chinese telecoms giant Huawei said last year that sanctions imposed on the company by the US in 2019, were affecting US suppliers and global customers. 
Governments worldwide are unwinding support given businesses to help with the impact of coronavirus.
Public spending and borrowing increased across the world during the pandemic. This led to tax rises that have contributed to the cost-of-living squeeze, while most people's wages remain unchanged. 
Many developed economies have had policies designed to protect workers - such as furlough - and welfare policies to protect the lowest paid. 
Some economists suggest these policies could also push inflation higher as the support measures draw to a close.

8,Climate change,BBC News,Cornwall's rockpool species 'threatened by climate change',2022-01-20,"A study has found many rockpool species are threatened by climate change and would not survive crossing the English Channel's currents.
The University of Exeter's study focused on the St Piran's hermit crab, which reappeared in Cornwall in 2016.
It had not been seen in England since 1985 and was found to have travelled on ""freak"" currents from South Brittany in France, searching for a cooler climate.
Rising sea temperatures put many of England's rockpool species at risk.
Christophe Patterson, from the Centre for Ecology and Conservation on Exeter's Penryn Campus in Cornwall, said: ""We modelled how ocean currents could carry larvae from Brittany to the south-west UK, and we found very few opportunities for this to happen.
""Only once in every 10 years would the currents be suitable for the tiny St Piran's crab larvae to cross the Channel, and even on these currents, the time it takes for larvae to be carried to the UK is much longer than most other species' larvae can survive.
""Other groups like sea snails, sponges and seaweed just don't live for long enough in open water to get here.""
The study focused specifically on the tiny crab clibanarius erythropus, which is usually found in the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and eastern Atlantic.
The BBC's Springwatch show ran a competition to give the species a common name, with viewer's choosing ""St Piran's crab"" after Cornwall's patron saint.

9,Climate change,athan Amos,A68: 'Megaberg' dumped huge volume of fresh water,2022-01-20,"The monster iceberg A68 was dumping more than 1.5 billion tonnes of fresh water into the ocean every single day at the height of its melting.
To put that in context, it's about 150 times the amount of water used daily by all UK citizens.
A68 was, for a short period, the world's biggest iceberg.
It covered an area of nearly 6,000 sq km (2,300 sq miles) when it broke free from Antarctica in 2017. But by early 2021, it had vanished.
One trillion tonnes of ice, gone.
Researchers are currently busy trying to gauge the impact A68 had on the environment.
And a team led from Leeds University has been back through all the satellite data to calculate the behemoth's changing dimensions as it moved north from the White Continent, through the Southern Ocean and up into the South Atlantic.
This has enabled the group to assess varying melt rates during the course of the megaberg's three-and-a-half-year existence.
One of the key periods, obviously, was towards the end, as A68 approached the warmer climes of the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia.

For a while, there were fears the giant block could ground in the surrounding shallows, blocking the foraging routes of millions of penguins, seals and whales.
But it never quite happened because, as the team can now show, A68 lost sufficient depth of keel to stay afloat.
""It does seem that it briefly touched the continental shelf. That's when the berg took a turn and we saw a small piece break off. But it wasn't enough to ground A68,"" lead author Ms Anne Braakmann-Folgmann from the Nerc Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at Leeds told BBC News.
""And I think you can see why in the thickness estimates,"" added co-author Prof Andrew Shepherd. ""By that stage the berg's keel was 141m, on average, and the bathymetry (depth) charts in the area showed 150m. It was a close call in the end.""
By April 2021, A68 had broken into countless small fragments that were beyond tracking. But its ecosystem impacts will have been much longer-lived. 
Giant tabular, or flat-topped, bergs are now recognised to have considerable influence wherever they roam. 
Their freshwater inputs will alter local currents. And all the iron, other minerals, and even organic matter picked up through their lives and subsequently dropped into the ocean will seed biological production.
The British Antarctic Survey managed to place some robotic gliders in the vicinity of A68 to monitor conditions before the ice mass totally wasted away. 
The data retrieved from these and other instruments, although not yet fully analysed, was revealing some interesting features, said biological oceanographer Prof Geraint Tarling.
""We think there's a really strong signal in the changing flora of the phytoplankton species around A68, and also in the actual deposition of material to the deeper parts of the ocean. The particle sensor on the glider was picking up some very strong signals of deposition coming from the berg,"" he told BBC News.
Details of A68's changing shape and freshwater fluxes are contained in a paper published in the journal Remote Sensing of Environment.

10,Climate change,Suzanne Bearne,The people moving from high to low-carbon careers,2022-01-20,"Watching the Red Arrows jet across the sky as a young boy, Todd Smith knew that flying was what he wanted to do when he was older.
After five years' training, costing Â£100,000, followed by two years working as a flying instructor, he finally landed his dream job in his late twenties - working as an airline pilot.
But in 2019, the travel firm he was working for - Thomas Cook - collapsed.
By this time Mr Smith had become increasingly concerned about the growing threat of climate change, and the aviation sector's carbon emissions.
""I started connecting the dots, and was met with an uncomfortable conflict,"" he says.
""I wanted to get involved in [environmental protest group] Extinction Rebellion, but knew it would be career suicide, and I had a lot of debt. It would be easier to return to the industry and pay off the debt.""
Yet with the pandemic grounding aircraft, Mr Smith, who lives in the Berkshire town of Reading, decided to quit his high-flying career for good.
""Of course I prefer flying and visiting exotic destinations, and earning a decent salary,"" says the 32-year-old. ""But when confronted with the climate and ecological emergency, how could I possibly prioritise my needs, when we need to think collectively about how to tackle the biggest existential threat to humanity?""
Mr Smith is now a climate activist. He acts as a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion and is the co-founder of Safe Landing, a movement of climate-conscious aviation sector workers.
Giving up his dream job was a tough decision, he says. ""I'm doing this out of desperation, not out of choice. Financially I've been really struggling, I'm in a huge amount of debt, it's been challenging.""
But he adds: ""Taking action has been cathartic and eased my anxiety.""
Mr Smith's campaigning comes as a United Nation's climate change panel warned last summer that the world faced increasingly extreme heatwaves, droughts and flooding.
UN secretary-general AntÃ³nio Guterres said the study was ""code red for humanity"". Last October, the UK pledged to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This target will require big growth and investment in the low-carbon economy.
Mr Smith is far from the only person to leave a previous job due to concerns about the environment.
After working in the oil and gas industry in Denmark for 10 years, Nader Beltaji has moved to a low-carbon career. He now works as a project manager at renewable energy giant RWE. 
""I actually did my master's thesis on solar power and I wanted to go into that direction, but at the time there weren't many opportunities that caught my attention,"" says the 33-year-old who now lives in Wiltshire. ""Now the landscape has completely changed.""
Currently working on the construction of an offshore wind farm off north east England, Mr Beltaji says he has more job satisfaction these days.
""Climate change is certainly very much in the news, and offshore wind is part of the UK's big energy strategy, so it's good to be part of that, and know you're working on delivering the targets,"" he says. ""Oil and gas feels like quite a dying industry.""
Rachel Bowcutt used to work in the UK's dairy industry, which is known for being carbon intensive. The UN estimates that the dairy sector's global carbon dioxide emissions total some 1.7bn tonnes annually. That is more than the aviation sector's pre-pandemic 915m tonnes.
Previously, Ms Bowcutt was operations manager for the Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers for two years, before quitting to take up a job at perhaps the organisation's nemesis - The Vegan Society.
She went vegan after reading reports, such as this from Oxford University, saying that a vegan diet ""is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth"".
Ms Bowcutt says she had also started to feel uncomfortable about the dairy industry and its practices after watching a session at a work conference about the optimum time to take calves away from their mothers.
""It all felt a bit unnecessary in terms of animal welfare and the environmental impact. It got to the point where I thought this isn't for me anymore, and I wondered if there was an equivalent organisation for vegans - and the job came up.""
Ms Bowcutt, who lives in Leamington Spa, in Warwickshire, started at the Vegan Society last year. ""I have much more confidence about the work I'm involved in. I can see the benefits, it's easier to promote and a subject matter I really believe in.""
The move to low-carbon jobs is urgently needed, argues Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Denis Fernando.
""There is a climate emergency, and we need drastic action to make things happen, so we'll [need to] see more of a push towards green workforces,"" he says. ""Green jobs create jobs. Everyone wins.
""There's a strong understanding towards moving towards green and low-carbon jobs, and an overall trend of people who want to do it, but we are deficient in terms of green skills.
""There's intention, but government policy could do more to quickly get more apprentices so they can start building skills. It can't be done to scale unless the government gives more resources to local councils.""
New Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.
A government spokesperson says: ""The UK is capitalising on the green industrial revolution, with over 56,000 clean jobs created and supported in the UK's green industries since the launch of the prime minister's Ten Point Plan. 
""These range from electric vehicle manufacturing in Sunderland, hydrogen facilities in Teesside, to new floating offshore wind farms and factories in Wales and Scotland.
""To build on this, we are ensuring people have the right skills for employment in Britain's new low carbon industries, through measures ranging from green skills boot camps, to dedicated apprenticeships, as we support new British industries, green jobs and economic growth.""
Mr Fernando says green jobs have multiple benefits, including reducing the impact on the climate and restoring nature, and can involve millions of us.
""Green jobs could be anything from working on renewable wind turbines or ecology, but also bicycle repair, customer service at a railway station or a warehouse manager for a freight warehouse going by rail rather than air.
""We really need try to think of the big agenda which everyone can participate in.""

11,Climate change,BBC News,Isle of Man ministers commit to review offshore energy strategy,2022-01-19,"The Isle of Man's Council of Ministers has committed to reviewing its offshore energy strategy after Tynwald backed the move.
Rob Mercer MLC had argued the current document from 2014 was now ""outdated"".
Backing the review, Environment Minister Clare Barber said it was an ""opportune moment"" to revisit it. 
The debate followed the granting of a four-month extension to a licence to allow local company Crogga to explore for gas.
That decision sparked a protest outside the Tynwald buildings on Tuesday.
The original document said offshore wind, marine renewables and hydrocarbon extraction projects could be developed in Manx waters, with the resulting electricity exported to the UK. 
Mr Mercer said public awareness and the cost of generation had ""shifted significantly"" since the strategy was put in place, and it had to be updated before ""critical"" choices are made.
During the debate, Tynwald members made reference to the potential extraction of gas by Crogga, with a decision over a long-term extension to the company's licence to be made later this year.
MLC Paul Craine called for a ""substantial refocus"" toward wind and marine renewable electricity instead.  
However, Stu Peters MHK, who was the only member not to support the motion, said he felt nothing should be done to stop a commercial operator from extracting gas ""if it is available as expected"".
The island must ""aim for energy security"", he added.
Ms Barber told Tynwald the strategy would now be reviewed, with an update provided to to the parliament by the end of June. 
The Isle of Man government has committed to reaching a target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

12,Climate change,Louise Cullen,First NI environment strategy 'should be more ambitious',2022-01-19,"More than 30 organisations and individuals have called for greater ambition in Northern Ireland's first-ever environment strategy.  
It comes after a Stormont committee was told the target for increasing woodland cover was outdated.
A consultation on the draft strategy closed on Tuesday. 
Agriculture and Environment Minister Edwin Poots said it would ""form the basis for a coherent and effective set of interventions"".
These could deliver real improvements in the quality of the environment, he added.
But it has been criticised as having out-of-date targets, or ones that fall short of what is promised in other UK jurisdictions and the Republic of Ireland.  
The RSPB in Northern Ireland co-ordinated the open letter sent to the first and deputy first ministers.  
Its director welcomed the consultation on the strategy, but said she was concerned that it did not ""adequately address"" the climate emergency.  
""The majority of commitments outlined in the strategy are not time-bound or binding, with some of the targets falling short of actions currently required by law,"" Joanne Sherwood said.  
""This is simply not good enough.
""This decade is crucial for action, and the decisions made by the Northern Ireland Executive now will have lasting impacts for generations to come.""
The letter was signed by organisations including Friends of the Earth NI, Keep Northern Ireland Beautiful, Action Renewables and Ulster Wildlife.  
It described the strategy as ""unambitious"" and ""lacking specificity"", and called on the Northern Ireland Executive to take a series of actions to bolster it, including ""dedicated and long-term resourcing"" and ""robust governance"".   
The environment strategy comes under the umbrella of the Green Growth Strategy, which seeks to balance addressing climate change and improving the environment with developing the economy.  
When finished, the strategy will be the first time Northern Ireland has had defined targets for the environment in one document.  
Earlier in January, a Stormont committee heard criticisms of the target for increasing woodland cover.
The strategy proposes increasing woodland cover in Northern Ireland to 8.8% by 2030 - a figure, an official said, that came from an archived woodland register ""and will be more ambitious in the final version"". 
Northern Ireland is one of the most deforested places in Europe. 
Two officials told environment committee members the 8.8% figure would be revised.  
""That is essentially out of date,"" Simon Webb from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs' environment strategy team said.  
""It's based off an archived figure of the Woodland Register, and we'll be seeking to update that.  
""So that target will be more ambitious in the final version.""
That would see a higher target being set, the head of the Forest Planning Branch, Richard Schaible, said.  
""The revision will be to just over 9%, rather than 8.8%,"" he added.
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) committee member William Irwin expressed concern about the challenge of planting enough trees to meet that target.  
""It's a very big challenge,"" Mr Schaible replied.  
""It will involve land use change.  
""There are more than 23,000 farm businesses in Northern Ireland. A very small percentage of those have engaged with our forestry grant schemes.  
""In fact, probably in the order of 90% haven't.  
""If a significant number of farm businesses came forward with a proposal to plant a very modest area, we would be able to achieve the Forests For Our Future programme and even go beyond that.""  
Northern Ireland is still the only part of the UK not to have any climate change legislation in place, although two bills are on the path to becoming legislation.

13,Climate change,BBC News,Climate protesters call for ban on Manx fossil fuel extraction,2022-01-18,"A ban on extracting fossil fuels on the Isle of Man is needed to ""mitigate some of the worst effects of climate change"", protesters have said.
Extinction Rebellion Isle of Man held a demonstration outside Tynwald to oppose a four-month extension to local company Crogga's licence to explore for gas.
Environment Minister Clare Barber said it allowed for consideration of energy policy before a firm decision is made. 
Protestor Jordan McCarthy said it was a ""betrayal"" of climate commitments. 
About thirty people gathered outside the Tynwald buildings in Douglas to express their concerns about any gas extraction on the island or in its territorial seas.
Mr McCarthy, one of the organisers for Extinction Rebellion Isle of Man, said natural gas and fossil fuels ""have to remain in the ground"" and called for a ban on any future extraction. 
Calling for action to be taken ""right now"" to stop any further release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, he said ""a lot of the worst effects of climate change are already locked in"".
Crogga has identified what it claims is a viable gas reserve in a 266 sq km (165 sq mile) area off Maughold Head on the island's east coast.
The firm was granted an extension in December to continue work under phase B of its exploration licence, which allows for seismic surveys to take place.
Ms Barber said the time would allow for a ""broader discussion"" on energy production policy, as well as for further talks with the company, before any decision over a ""full extension"" of the licence was made. 
This included how the firm would ""fulfil their obligations under the Climate Change Act"", she added.
The Isle of Man government has committed to a target of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

14,Climate change,BBC News,Extinction Rebellion blasts Cornwall Council's 'hot air' on climate,2022-01-18,"Campaign group Extinction Rebellion has accused Cornwall Council of failing to take enough action since declaring a ""climate change emergency"" at the start of 2019.
Protestors claimed the authority's response had been too ""slow-paced"" and described it at ""three years of hot air"".
Dozens demonstrated outside the council's headquarters in Truro.
The authority insisted it had made achievements in a number of areas.
A group of about 50 climate protestors gathered outside county hall while councillors attended a full meeting of the authority.
Demonstrator Tim Snell said: ""Three years ago almost to the day Cornwall Council declared a climate change emergency, and we haven't nearly seen enough action within that time.
""We can't hold on for another three years of slow-paced action that doesn't quite go far enough,"" he said.
""The crisis is so severe, the future we face is absolutely dire,"" he added.
Mr Snell described it as ""absolutely scandalous"" that Cornwall Council was paying around Â£500,000 towards the Public Service Obligation (PSO) flight from Newquay to Gatwick, which is currently at 48% capacity.
The service has recently restarted after stopping due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Martyn Alvey, portfolio holder for the environment and climate change, said it was ""early days"" for the service and the council was ""convinced that it is important for the economy of Cornwall to have the connection to London by air"".
Martyn Alvey said the council had made progress in a number of areas to help tackle climate change, including adding solar panels to 600 Cornwall Housing homes.
He added: ""We've got the investment that we've made in geothermal, the floating offshore wind power investment that we're making - also Cornwall Council's brought online its first smart grid wind turbine,"" he said.
Mr Alvey also said another 150 electric vehicle charging points were due to come online in the authority's car parks, bringing the total number up to 360.

15,Climate change,Sally Bowman,Sustainable farming: Mum and daughter farmers take part in pilot,2022-01-18,"A mother-and-daughter farming family is among the first in the country to be part of a government pilot scheme.
Dairy farmers Tracey Langton and her daughter Jess, from Langley Mill, Derbyshire, are trialling a new way of paying farmers for land management.
The family welcomed the pilot, which aims to make farming more sustainable.
A spokesperson for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the scheme would eventually be open to all farmers.
The three-year pilot is for a scheme known as the Sustainable Farming Incentive, which is part of plans to replace the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).
Under CAP, farmers received taxpayers' cash proportional to the amount of land they owned.
But the government plans to make payments for protecting species, planting trees and hedges, cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and protecting water courses and the soil.
Jess said: ""Today we have been planting some silver birch trees.
""We don't really use the area where we planted them and we would like to use it to become more regenerative and sustainable and tackle the challenges of climate change.
""By incorporating sustainable practices on our farm, we are more likely to be able to do our bit for climate change.""
Her mother Tracey added: ""To be honest, the woodland just happens to be here and we don't see it as such a valuable asset but now, as farmers are learning, these are probably our most valuable assets.""
She said the details of the new payments had been slow to be revealed.
""I think the detail has been a little bit late, but that's why we jumped straight onto the pilot as soon as we could,"" she said.
""We're getting the information and we're getting it first.""
The new initiatives have their critics, with some - including wildlife trusts - branding them ""unambitious"".
Jess said there were challenges involved in how farming should respond to the threat of climate change.
""If we're talking about rewilding a lot of the land, then that land can't be used for food production and therefore we have to import more [and] the carbon footprint is raised from the fuel costs,"" she said.
A Defra group spokesperson said: ""The Sustainable Farming Incentive will fund sustainable farming activities, and will eventually be open to all farmers.
""We are designing it in partnership with farmers and it is all about supporting the choices they take for their own holdings.""

16,Climate change,Roger Harrabin,Government says its climate change curbs inadequate,2022-01-17,"The government has admitted that its efforts to insulate the UK from climate change impacts have been inadequate.
The costs of climate change to Britain are ""high and increasing"", it says, and could reach many billions of pounds a year.
Ministers say they'll have to go much further and faster to curb the worst impacts.
It means climate change must be built into all long-term decisions, such as new housing or infrastructure. 
The aim should be to avoid costly remedial actions in the future.  
The government has also accepted that it must consider low-probability but high-impact events arising from a heating climate. 
The report is a response to an analysis of the UKâs vulnerability to climate change by the official advisers, the Climate Change Committee.
""Climate change is happening now. It is one of the biggest challenges of our generation and has already begun to cause irreversible damage to our planet and way of life,"" the report begins.
It earmarks 61 climate risks cutting across multiple sectors of society. 
Health and productivity could be affected, it says, with impacts on many households, businesses and public services.
The report warns of worsening soil health and farm productivity, reduced water availability, and impacts on alternative energy supply. 
For example, it notes, unless the UK takes further action, the cost of flood-related damages for non-residential properties is expected to increase by 27% by 2050 and 40% by 2080. 
That's with a temperature rise of just 2C - and even that relatively low figure is looking very hard to achieve.
If temperature rises to 4C â which the governmentâs science advisers say is possible - this increases to 44% and 75% respectively. 
The government says itâs already investing to adapt to climate change. 
It mentions: 
But critics say efforts so far have been diluted by inadequate finance from the Treasury for long-term schemes. Indeed the chancellor didnât mention climate change once in his Budget.
Green MP Caroline Lucas MP said: ""It's crystal clear that we are moving nothing like fast enough to net zero emissions and the longer we delay, the more it will cost. The government acknowledges the risks. We have yet to see the action plan that will deal with them."" 
Ministers admit they must do much more. 
Climate Adaptation Minister Jo Churchill said: âThe scale and severity of the challenge posed by climate change means we canât tackle it overnight, and although weâve made good progress in recent year, there is clearly much more that we need to do.""
Labour's shadow environment secretary Jim McMahon said: ""After more than a decade in power, the Conservatives have failed to build the efficient homes, strengthened flood defences, and resilient natural habitats necessary to tackle the climate crisis.
""Their lack of action and empty promises are putting people, nature, and our economy at risk.""

17,Climate change,Georgina Rannard,Climate-related deaths fall in England and Wales - ONS,2022-01-17,"Climate-related deaths in England and Wales fell between 2001 and 2020, according to a new analysis of data by the Office of National Statistics.
Hot days saw more injuries, violence and suicide but the relatively small rise in deaths was offset by warmer winter temperatures resulting in fewer.
Climate change is a substantial threat to human health globally.
Scientists do not yet have enough information about the health impact to make a prediction about the future.
But the trends showing a changing climate are very clear, ONS epidemiology in climate and global health head Myer Glickman told BBC News.
The new analysis was experimental, he said. The method would be developed and improved.
And future assessments should look at local, rather than national average, temperatures and local health data.
Previous research links heatwaves with deaths from heart or breathing conditions.
In the UK, the period 1991 to 2020 was 0.9C warmer than 1961 to 1990, according to the Met Office. 
And the 10 warmest years recorded have been since 2002.
Statistics can be slippery, as these new climate-death figures show.
The headline climate-related deaths in England and Wales have fallen is encouraging, suggesting warmer winters are offsetting the negative effects of hotter summer days.
But dig a bit deeper and lots of other factors are at play.  
Improved insulation, more help with fuel bills for the elderly and vulnerable and widespread flu jabs will also have reduced the winter death toll. 
This is why the ONS describes these figures as ""experimental"" and says more work is needed to separate out the relative role of these different drivers. 
That is the key point here.  
We do not yet know how seriously climate change will affect our health but we do know it ""has already begun to cause irreversible damage to our planet"", according to the UK government.
So the important thing is more attention is being given to this crucial issue - because the better we understand the risks, the better able we should be to plan for them.

18,Climate change,Ruth Bradley,Energy bills: Thermal imaging used to help with cost of heat loss,2022-01-17,"People in parts of Somerset have been offered the use of thermal imaging cameras to help them save on their energy bills. 
South Somerset District Council bought two infrared cameras and loaned them to parish councils.
They have been used to show people where heat was escaping from their homes.
Meanwhile a separate project helped park home residents in Somerset to improve their energy efficiency.
At dusk in Charlton Musgrove, near Wincanton, Clare Atkinson watched live multicoloured pictures of her house on a mobile phone screen.
The windows glowed white, while there were blues and purples on cooler - better insulated - parts. 
The phone was connected to one of two council-owned thermal imaging cameras, costing around Â£300 each.
""The main part of the cottage stays warm quite nicely but there's an 1980s extension where we lose a lot of heat,"" said Clare.
Clare said they fitted curtains over the inside of their doors to try and keep the heat in.
""We're mindful of how much energy is costing, and obviously the environment is something we want to do our bit for, to make sure we aren't wasting energy,"" she said.
Retrofit Bruton and Cary was set up by the local town councils, is funded by the Somerset Climate Emergency Community Fund, and looks after the thermal imaging cameras for the area.
Justine Mallinson from the organisation used the camera on Claire's house.
""It gives people a visual reference because a lot of what's going on in a property you can't see because it's behind plaster or ceilings,"" she said.
""You'd be surprised at the amount of heat that having your curtains shut at dusk can save. And, if you can, tucking your curtains behind the radiator so the heat all stays in the room rather than going up behind the curtains and out of the windows,"" Justine said.
Justine has worked in the retrofit industry, in which older homes are adapted with new technology, for 15 years and says there's been a big change in the public's mindset over the past three or four years.
""People are very engaged in doing something to their property, and as our gas and electric bills go up, there's never been a better time to insulate your property than now,"" said Justine.
South Somerset Lib Dem district councillor Henry Hobhouse set up the thermal imaging project.
He drove past 400 homes in Yeovil with a similar camera a few years ago and was amazed at how much heat was being lost out of poorly-insulated front doors.
The cameras are being used on homes around Castle Cary and Bruton where Mr Hobhouse said residents could have problems, despite seeming to be an affluent area.
""There is rural poverty across Somerset. A lot of the people who live in rural areas are having to get support and help, like from foodbanks,"" he said.
Once people have used the cameras to find any issues, the council says there is advice available on grants and funding for energy improvements.
Meanwhile across Somerset, low-income residents of 28 park homes have had their homes' insulation and ventilation improved and fully paid for under a government scheme.
""Park homes are one of the most challenging types of homes to keep warm and to improve,"" said councillor Richard Pinnock, from Mendip District Council.
""They are often lived in by older people on limited income, and at risk of fuel poverty.""
Park Home owner Marilyn White said her home takes ""a fraction of the time"" to warm up now.

His charity runs one of the tree-planting programmes the Welsh government funds in Africa.
It has planted about four million trees in Kenya's BorÃ© community since 2012.
The project has expanded significantly over the course of the past decade, from getting 1,000 cashew trees in the ground initially to ambitions to plant one million trees this year.
They will include 19 varieties, some of which provide food and timber to the community and others to create wildlife habitats and improve biodiversity.
The funding comes via Welsh government, the charity Size of Wales and takings from two innovative climate change charity shops in Lampeter and Aberystwyth.
""It's all about helping the local people protect their existing forest and plant new trees to suck down carbon from the atmosphere and improve the climate for everyone,"" Mr Hartwell explained in a video call from the BorÃ© Community Forest Project.
One of the ""tragic ironies of climate change,"" he said was poorer nations that had contributed least to the carbon emissions problem were being worst hit by the impacts of rising temperatures and extreme weather.
""Wales has a very long history of releasing carbon,"" he said.
""We've got one of the longest legacy footprints of any country in the world because of the industrialisation that came with the south Wales coalfield.
""The model of industrial development based on the exploitation of fossil fuels was invented in south Wales and every other country in the world has gone on to kind of emulate that.  
""So, because we were the first industrialised nation, we have a particular responsibility to draw back some of that ancient, historical carbon.""
The project has led to the establishment of the largest tree nursery in Coast Province, Kenya, working with more than 3,000 farmers and 200 schools.
It is here that trees will be grown for the Arsenal Forest - a new woodland being created by the Premier League club to make up for some of the carbon released in printing the Arsenal matchday programme.
""The people here have got very small carbon footprints, they don't drive or fly around all the time like we do in the West,"" explained Mr Hartwell's daughter Anna Douglas - an ecologist based in Denmark who has been volunteering at the project since it started.
""But for them climate change is happening right now,"" she said, with crop failures driven by changing weather patterns.
Welsh funding has also led to the planting of 15 million trees in Uganda over the past decade, with the Welsh government aiming to reach 25 million by 2025.
The project is situated in the Mbale region, where a combination of climate change and excessive logging has led to flooding and fatal landslides.
For every child born or adopted in Wales a tree is planted in the region, as well as in Wales.
However, ministers have repeatedly faced questions over the failure to meet domestic tree-planting targets with Wales lagging significantly behind the rest of the UK.
Deputy climate change minister Lee Waters recently announced plans to plant 86 million trees by 2030, with every household to be offered a free sapling to plant in their garden as part of this drive.

20,Climate change,glas Fraser,Gas pressure on consumers builds further,2022-01-16,"Monday brings a big moment for Scotland's energy transition. Winners in the auction for 15 ScotWind sea areas will be announced.
Covering 8,600 square kilometres, the announcement starts the process of a gigantic effort to put as many as 1,200 turbines out at sea. Many will be of the pioneering floating variety, giving us much more marine wind potential in deeper water.
They should, on average production, generate around twice the electricity Scotland needs, though that demand will rise as the nation transitions from carbon fuels to far more electricity use.
Faith in that transition is being shaken by the exceptionally high costs for energy coming down the pipeline. Prices are already up. Household bills have been capped, and that cap is likely to rise by about 50% from April.
There's no way out of the rising bills. Ofgem, the regulator, is obliged by law to pass on the costs of sourcing energy.
We'll find out on 7 February just how high they are going to rise in spring, with the new price cap reflecting the recent soaring price of natural gas.
There are ways to mitigate that rise. The government could cut 5% VAT, though that would make only a limited difference, and the biggest part of the tax giveaway would be to well-off people who use the most energy. 
Cutting tax, when it is already only a quarter of the VAT rate for most goods and service, would run counter to the net-zero policy of reducing use of fossil fuels.
Alternatively, governments - in Holyrood as well as Westminster - could use their resources to offset the impact on the households in most fuel poverty, by expanding the size and reach of welfare benefits, most obviously the Â£140 per year Warm Homes Discount on bills.
With around Â£600 to Â£700 extra being loaded onto the annual average bill from April, that would have to be a big uplift to provide the support many people will need.
Or government at Westminster could guarantee loans to energy suppliers so that they continue to absorb the increased cost of wholesale gas and electricity, and smooth the effect of the higher input costs. 
But that assumes there will be lower wholesale and other costs from spring onwards: that last autumn and this winter have seen exceptional spikes in prices, and we'll return to energy trading to normal. 
That's a bold assumption. Here's why, and here are some factors to watch over the next few months.
Gas has gone global.  It used to be bought in forward contracts along pipelines, suiting suppliers and customers. The market was regional, dictated by the limitations of pipelines. That has changed. 
While a lot of gas is bought on the forward market - a guaranteed price to deliver in a set number of months after the contract is struck - a higher proportion of it is now traded in the volatile spot market.
That's the price for delivery the month after next, that has gone from less than 50p a therm for years, to more than Â£4 in a recent spike. It has since fallen to below Â£2, but continued volatility is expected.
The fall since the start of the year is partly because of the arrival in European ports of ocean-going tankers loaded with LNG, liquified natural gas. These ships, from Qatar or the Gulf of Mexico, go where the price paid is highest, and that's anywhere around the world.
So when economies are back to growth in Asia, they bid up the price of the LNG shipments.
There's unfinished business back in Britain. We are yet to pay the price of rescuing nearly 30 companies that ceased trading since September.  
The average cost of each customer being taken on by one of the surviving companies is estimated at around Â£1,000. That's the cost of buying further gas supplies for new customers in the market, at a much higher spot price than customers are currently paying. 
It also includes the repayment of account credit balances built up by customers over last summer. The deceased suppliers burned through those balances in trying to keep buying on that fast-rising short-term wholesale market. 
Surviving suppliers expect to recoup that cost through the Supplier of Last Resort (SoLR) system, and that can be expected to appear in bills from next autumn.
So with forward prices for gas in the winter of 2022-23 currently in the region of Â£2 per therm (four times the price a year ago), and with those extra costs being loaded on, industry insiders say prices will either stay high or they could go a further Â£500 or Â£600 higher from October.
The energy market is changing. The exceptionally low level of wind across Europe during much of 2021 meant there was a need for back-up, also known as baseload. 
Nuclear plants, such as Hunterston, are being closed and in Britain, they are replaced very slowly or not at all. Coal-burning is being shut down. So there is more dependence on gas to provide the baseload supply, meaning demand for gas is up.
That has left less of the supply to replenish gas storage. The UK has very little gas storage, preferring to see its upstream primary resource as a form of energy security. 
But European countries have lots more storage capacity, and it's been running very low for months.
The coming summer will need to see the stocks built up again for next winter. That will require a return to normal wind speeds and a steady supply of gasâ¦ which brings us to Vladimir Putin.
Europe depends heavily on Russia - Britain much less so, but its gas prices are heavily influenced by demand and supply across Europe.
While Norway has stepped up supply through a growing number of pipelines, Russia is in a high-stakes geo-political duel with countries it sees as adversaries on its western flank.
Its political leadership is threatening a further invasion of Ukraine, at the same time as demanding that the Nato defence alliance pull troops and weapons back from Russia's frontier and that it pledges not to allow further countries to join. 
The ultimatum, thrown down just before Christmas, looks as if it's designed to be rejected by a Kremlin administration that wants to crank up the tensions.
Russia wants to commission a Gazprom pipeline already installed from Russia to Germany, but that is fiercely opposed by the USA, it has been stalled by Germany, and its future is tied up with events in Ukraine. 
Russia says it has fulfilled its contractual commitments to supply gas through other pipelines, but it is accused of controlling the tap on further supplies in order to put political pressure onto the countries that depend on it.
Such behaviour over the past decade is one of the main reasons customers have diversified supply to LNG and to Norway, but there is still a reliance on Russia and a vulnerability. 
And as Russia gets more belligerent, there is more pressure placed on to the LNG tanker market.
The early stages of talks between the US and Russia, and then between Nato and Russia, have not shown much sign of reducing this tension.
Students of international relations might wonder where the British PM is in this sharply rising period of international tensions, given that the UK has a seat on the UN Security Council and is one of Nato's bigger contributors. The answer: in a career-threatening crisis about partying and boozing in Downing Street.
Government policy is for the distribution costs of electricity - the high voltage cabling and local distribution networks - to be shifted on to gas. That is part of the response to global warming, and the pledge to get to net zero. 
The idea is to create a strengthening incentive to shift from gas to electricity. Given current price rises, that doesn't look imminent. But it remains policy.
That drive towards net zero was given a lot of impetus by the COP26 gathering in Glasgow last November.
You may recall that conference nearly foundered on the issue of whether coal was to be ""phased out"" or, in the words of the final agreement ""phased down"". What followed some weeks later was a report from the International Energy Agency, showing that burning of coal reached new records last year. 
China and India, in particular, are using coal to fuel economic growth, with China hard hit in recent months by a shortage of power supply.
With gas prices high globally, coal has become a financially attractive alternative. Britain has returned to coal-burning to support that electricity baseload - a last gasp in the final years before its coal plants are finally extinguished.
COP26 also featured pressure on the British government and others to put a stop to further drilling for oil and gas. The imperative of limiting the rise in global temperatures is reckoned to mean that we have already tapped all the reserves we can allow ourselves to exploit.
And yet with both gas and oil prices riding high, investment is back into boom times.
Rystad energy consultancy says it is on course to rise from $601bn to $628bn this year. It has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels, but it is on course to do so by 2024. 
As part of that, gas and LNG upstream investments are rising 14% to $149bn. Upstream oil (exploration and production, that is) is rising 7% to $307bn.
The campaign to 'keep it in the ground' is not going well.

22,Climate change,Jonathan Amos,How a colossal block of ice became an obsession,2022-01-15,"Did you develop an obsession during lockdown? Did those long weeks and months take you down surprising avenues? Where did your mind wander? 
The Swiss-based British artist Kevin Eason found himself thinking about Antarctica and one particularly large chunk of ice. He'd read an article, by me as it happens, about a 300-billion-tonne iceberg that had recently calved from the east of the continent. D28, it's called; although that's not its only name as I'll explain. 
Kevin's interest was piqued by the satellite images that scientists began publishing of this berg, along with the sometimes surprising colours they would choose to render scenes and emphasise contrast. 
""It started out quite small. Just little studies,"" the artist recalls. 
""I found myself taking images that I'd see of D28, dropping them into Photoshop, and making colour samples. I was basically making pantones from Antarctica based on images that were being circulated around the internet.
""I spent weeks mixing the paint to match these colours. I guess it was a form of meditation. And then I was bound to the studio, and so it just started developing into something.""
That something is a series of four oil paintings depicting the life of D28. The first picture captures the definitive and distinctive outline of the berg in the days immediately after it broke from the edge of Antarctica's Amery Ice Shelf. The ones that follow are from Kevin's imagination. 
The series marks the years 2019, 2021, 2023, and 2025. We don't know when that final, speculative view will occur, but it will happen eventually. Icebergs are born to wither and melt away.
Those people who've seen the series have had various reactions, but some of the themes are common. You won't be surprised to learn that when asked to describe an emotion or feeling, the words that viewers used included ""transformation"", ""scale"", ""time"", ""isolation"", ""drifting"", ""silence"", ""change"",  ""awareness"", and ""loss"".
And, quite naturally, Kevin's D28 journey has brought environmental issues - and the loss of ice - to the forefront of his mind. Being in Switzerland, this is a very topical concern. Alpine glaciers are retreating rapidly in our warming climate, prompting local people to blanket the ice streams in Summer to try to protect them. 
""If I can produce a work of art that might have some sort of impact, or assist in some way; that might help slow down consumption or make people consider things a little bit more by taking fewer flights, or driving their cars less - that's got to be a good way to go,"" says Kevin.
My own interest in D28 goes back to the mid-2000s, long before it calved. At that time I was reporting research on the Amery Ice Shelf that sought to predict which part of this vast, floating wedge of ice might break first, and when. 
Attention had focused on an area that became nicknamed ""Loose Tooth"" because it looked in satellite images like a child's wobbly front tooth. 
The team studying the cracks developing in the ice shelf thought a calving might be imminent. It wasn't. Loose Tooth is still there, still wobbling, still hanging on to the Amery. It was the adjacent, 1,636-sq-km section that came away - the big berg now formally designated D28 (the largest Antarctic bergs are given an official listing by the US National Ice Center).
I joked with the Amery research team, led by Prof Helen Fricker from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, that perhaps another dental analogy was needed. ""It is the molar compared to a baby tooth,"" Helen laughed. And the nickname stuck.
People regularly now post satellite pictures of ""Molar Berg"", aka D28, as it bumps and grinds its way around the Antarctic coast. Even astronauts on the space station can see it, albeit from an oblique angle.
A keen observer is Dr Catherine Walker from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. As a graduate student in the 2000s, she was tasked with studying those cracks in the Amery Ice Shelf.
""It was actually sort of sad to see it go, because it was something that I'd had all this time, and then it was gone,"" Catherine tells me.
""I really appreciate Kevin's paintings. I feel like that's my entire career right there.""
There's a growing appreciation of these city-sized bergs (Molar Berg was bigger than Greater London when it broke away). 
They dump huge quantities of fresh water into the wider ocean, along with iron and other minerals scraped off the Antarctic landmass. This influences the behaviour of local currents and food webs. 
D28/Molar Berg's travels have taken it a full quarter turn around the White Continent. It's now entered the Weddell Sea which is directly south of the Atlantic Ocean.
And it just so happens that it's moving in the direction of what is currently the world's biggest iceberg - a near-4,000-sq-km monster known as A23, which has been pinned fast to the Weddell seafloor for three decades. 
""Yep, that's one of mine, too,"" says Catherine. ""I always watch A23 because we're the same age. It calved in 1986 and it's started to wiggle recently.
""What's the fascination with these giant icebergs? I guess it has something to do with their size; they're so much bigger than you can imagine - like Everest or K2. You look at them and wonder: how do they hold themselves together.""
I think that's right. Their great scale is truly awesome. But for me it's also the way such imposing objects, built from snows that originally fell on Antarctica thousands of years ago, and which seem as though they ought to be so permanent, can suddenly disintegrate and fade away in a very short time.

24,COP26,Christine Ro,The 'green' row over the UK's largest renewable power plant,2022-01-14,"This is the second of two articles examining the way wood pellets are produced and used as a green energy source. The first article can be found here.
The Drax power station near Selby, Yorkshire, is surrounded by both busy roads and small farms. A faint humming noise emanates all around the complex, while water vapour rises slowly and steadily from the cooling towers.
The scale of operations at this converted coal plant is gargantuan. It's the UK's largest renewable power station. Wood pellets are imported from the US on enormous ships that take up to 21 days in transit. They are then transported overland via rail, and Drax receives about 17 deliveries of wood pellets a day, operating 24 hours a day, six days a week. 
Once inside, the pellets are pulverised into a powder, blown into boilers and then burnt. The steam from this process powers turbines that produce electricity.
In 2020, Drax generated 11% of the UK's renewable power - enough for four million homes. While the UK is by far the largest consumer of wood pellets, globally, biomass is a massive industry that is growing in value and reach. 
The EU is also a major market, and South Korea and Japan are increasingly interested as well. This means that the search has widened for new sources of wood, for instance from Estonia.
Yet, Drax's green credentials have been comprehensively challenged by environmentalists and others recently. The climate think tank, Ember, calculates that the power station is now the UK's single largest source of carbon dioxide. The firm's share price weakened on this news breaking although it has subsequently regained ground. The stock was removed from the S&P Global Clean Energy Index in October after the index changed its methodology.
When it comes to the arcane world of climate accounting, biomass energy is classed as renewable based on the premise that trees grow back. So greenhouse gas emissions from trees are counted in the nation of land use rather than the place where they are burnt. 
Yet, Mary Booth, founder of the environmental organisation Partnership for Policy Integrity, points out that ""just because something is counted as zero because of an accounting convention does not mean it's carbon neutral"".
More technology of business:
According to the think tank Chatham House, wood pellets from the US burnt in the UK generated 13-16 million tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2019 - equivalent to the emissions from 6-7 million cars. 
Drax disputes this analysis and a company spokesperson says its biomass ""meets the highest sustainability standards and these ensure that we do not use biomass that causes deforestation, forest decline or carbon debt"". 
Drax's latest annual report shows that its largest source of biomass pellets is low-grade roundwood. This is not waste and residue but wood that has little economic value. Yet it still has environmental value, if it were left intact to soak up atmospheric carbon.
In 2020, the company received Â£832m in UK government subsidies - which are set to continue until at least 2027. According to many environmentalists, this support would be better directed to wind and solar energy, which are more energy efficient, cost-effective and more carbon neutral.
At Glasgow's COP26 climate summit, officials did not take a clear stance on biomass - a leading EU climate official called for its biomass use, though with reservations.
However, the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use, signed by leaders of over 130 countries, does commit them to curbing forest loss by 2030.
It is as yet unclear how this is to be done. Elly Pepper, a campaigner at transatlantic environmental coalition, Cut Carbon Not Forests, warns the agreement will fail if countries do not come to terms with their dangerous reliance on biomass. 
""It's hypocritical for countries, including the UK, to sign this declaration while continuing billions in subsidies for this dirty energy industry,"" she says.
It seems unlikely that the UK government will end Drax's biomass subsidies ahead of their contracted end date in 2027. Some environmentalists have turned their sights instead to influencing future UK policy, such as the Biomass Strategy 2022. They're also hoping to reform the EU's Renewable Energy Directive, which subsidises biomass energy.
Peg Putt, who coordinates biomass campaigns for the Environmental Paper Network, worries that COP 26 could actually worsen the reliance on biomass. 
The agreement on ""the phase down of unabated coal power"" could actually be interpreted as permitting mixing biomass with coal, she says, because ""throwing biomass in with coal and co-firing appears to magically decrease the emissions and thus the emissions intensity of coal generation"".
Drax, meanwhile, is looking beyond the next decade. It has proposed the development of BECC, or bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. This is a technology that essentially removes and stores carbon dioxide. 
Drax argues that putting carbon dioxide under the North Sea will turn its operations carbon negative. Yet many environmentalists counter that this would just be a further licence to pollute.
Though there's been a public consultation process for the BECCS project, locals generally are not sure what is being proposed. The thick folders explaining the proposal at the library and the Drax-affiliated social club have been roundly ignored, while the consultation documents staked to a village field have whipped forlornly in the wind.
The future sourcing of energy is an especially hot topic due to the UK's current energy crisis. 
A dramatic rise in the price of wholesale gas is the main reason consumers are facing huge increases in energy bills, and has also caused the collapse of some energy providers.
Drax says that biomass is a reliable alternative source of energy, but many environmentalists remain sceptical.
""We need real transformative change, not false solutions like biomass,"" says Ms Pepper.

Middlesbrough's Marton West Beck defences include a screen to stop debris reaching areas where it could build up and block waterflow.
Upstream storage areas on Newham Beck will slow waterflow during heavy rainfall, the Environment Agency said.
Regional flood risk manager Jamie Fletcher said the project would also bring benefits for wildlife.
""Schemes such as this are essential for helping the North East adapt to climate change, which is bringing with it more extreme weather conditions and an increased flood risk,"" he said.
Improved flood walls and drainage are intended to reduce the flood risk from the beck, sea and surface water.
Construction on the project, run by the Environment Agency and Middlesbrough Council, started in summer 2020.
The local authority's executive member for the environment, Barrie Cooper, said the defences were ""hugely important"".
""For those affected by flooding, the impact can be catastrophic and life-changing,"" he said.
""These state-of-the-art defences are a great example of partnership working, and will give peace of mind to more than 500 families and many businesses for many years to come.""
Middlesbrough and the wider economy will save an estimated Â£58m in the future due to reduced flood-related damage, the agency said.

26,Climate change,BBC News,Cornwall Council apology over climate change policy failure,2022-01-12,"Officers at Cornwall Council have apologised for not implementing an environmental decision-making policy while assessing plans for a new air service between Newquay and London.
The council, which declared a climate emergency in 2021, had decided all projects should be assessed by a climate change ""decision-making wheel"".
Senior officers apologised to a scrutiny committee for the omission.
However, they said green concerns were examined.
Following its declaration of a climate emergency in January 2021 the council decided the decision wheel should be employed to determine the green impact of projects in its bid to become carbon neutral.
However, some councillors realised the decision-making process had not been applied in awarding the contract for the flights, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. 
At a meeting of the economic growth and development overview and scrutiny committee, Phil Mason, strategic director for economic growth and development, admitted staff ""didn't include"" the wheel in ""bringing the decision forward"".
He said: ""We should have done that and we didn't.""
Infrastructure director Nigel Blackler added: ""It was a serious omission on our part as officers and I appear before you... embarrassed to admit that.""
However, Mr Blackler said climate change impact was considered when making the decision.
He also said Eastern Airways had made commitments to minimise the impact in terms of carbon emissions and noise pollution, including aircraft being used having 40% lower carbon emissions than previous planes.
Councillors called for an all-member briefing to ensure councillors understand the decision wheel and how it was used by officers.
The direct flights to London are being subsidised by the government for two years.
Cornwall Council is to receive up to Â£1.8m in grants to run the year-round public service obligation (PSO) route.

27,UK climate change protests,BBC News,"Christian train activists went too far in climate protest, court hears",2022-01-11,"Three Christian environmentalists ""went too far"" in their climate change protest by stopping a busy train, a court has heard.
Passengers begged the Reverend Sue Parfitt, 79, Father Martin Newell, 54, and Philip Kingston, 85, to move from the rush-hour train at east London's Shadwell station in October 2019.
The trio refused until police officers arrived.
They had to unstick Mr Kingston after he glued himself to the locomotive.
Inner London Crown Court was told that Ms Parfitt, from Bristol, and Mr Newell, from Birmingham, used a ladder to climb on the train roof while Mr Kingston, from South Gloucestershire, superglued himself to the side of the carriage.
Prosecution barrister Edmund Blackman told the jury that although the three had the ""precious right"" to protest, in this case they went too far. 
The train was travelling from Lewisham to Bank shortly before 07:00 and was about three-quarters full.
The protest caused more than an hour of disruption and 15 Docklands Light Railway (DLR) services were delayed or cancelled.
The protesters, who are members of Christian Climate Action, an arm of Extinction Rebellion, deny charges of obstructing an engine or carriage on the railway.
The jury heard that a passenger pleaded ""we have got to go to work, the kids are on the train and we have got to go to school"".
In response, Mr Newell said he was ""sorry"", adding: ""But this is what we have to resort to"", as he refused calls from members of the public to come down.
Mr Blackman said the protesters had arrived at the station at about 06:45 and ""acting in concert"" had intended to cause rush-hour disruption.
These protesters ""deliberately acted unlawfully"" at a busy time of time of day with a demonstration aimed at ""attracting attention"" to the climate change crisis, he added.
British Transport Police Supt Richard Twyford said that any such protests could lead to safety risks such as congestion and crush hazards, and could force people to be evacuated.
The jury heard that some passengers told the environmentalists that the train they targeted was an electric train and should therefore not be the focus of the protest, while another commuter asked: ""How did you get to the station, did you walk here? Obviously you got here by a train or bus,"" the court was told.
The trial continues.

28,Climate change,BBC News,Isle of Man climate group against further gas exploration,2022-01-11,"Extracting fossil fuels from new sources on the Isle of Man would be ""unjustified and unacceptable"", a climate group has said.
The Isle of Man Climate Coalition's objection comes after local firm Crogga was granted a further four months to explore for gas off the Manx coast.
The government said this would allow time to consider its stance on offshore energy ahead of any long-term decision.
Joney Faragher MHK claimed it showed a ""lack of clear policy direction"". 
The Manx Labour Party leader is one of the founding members of the coalition, which includes the Liberal Vannin party, as well as collection of environmental charities and businesses.
In a statement, the group said using any extracted gas as a transition fuel was ""politically and ethically"" unjustified.
Ms Faragher said: ""The money is already there for transitioning to renewables, it is down to priorities, and at the moment we are simply not prioritising our transition"".
Crogga's extension allows it to continue seismic surveys and collect other geophysical data under phase B of the licence, which it must complete before it can undertake exploratory drilling.
The firm's chief executive Diccen Sargent previously said the potential reserve in a 266 sq km area of seabed off Maughold Head could ""transform the future of our island"".
Though Crogga requested a further 18-months, the Department of Infrastructure chose to instead give the island-based company until April to complete the work. 
Coalition member Pete Christian, who is also the co-ordinator of the Isle of Man Friends of the Earth, urged politicians to support a motion due in Tynwald next week calling for the government to review its offshore energy strategy.  
""We should not be funding development in renewable energy here by increasing non-renewable energy extraction, that is the bottom line,"" he added.

29,COP26,Christine Ro,The controversy of wood pellets as a green energy source,2022-01-11,"This is the first of two Business of Technology articles examining the way wood pellets are produced and used as an energy source.
The areas in and around North Carolina's forests feel spacious. Canopies of lanky pine trees eventually give way to enormous car parks and long-term storage units, underscoring the feeling of vastness.
Many of these US trees are destined to be turned into small pellets for the biomass industry. At wood pellet mills, wood is chipped, dried, ground and compressed into uniform, easily storable pellets. They're then shipped mainly to the UK, where they're burned for energy.
Most forest land in North Carolina is privately owned, in holdings that can be as small as one acre (0.4ha). This can mean they are too small to qualify for conservation easements - agreements encouraging landowners to keep trees intact, sometimes with tax benefits.
Small forest owners here include a number of third-generation African Americans whose ancestors moved north and west as part of the Great Migration (the movement of six million African Americans between 1916-70 out of the rural southern US to the urban Northeast, Midwest and West) leaving the cropland to turn back into forest. 
""A lot of minority landowners are really disconnected from their land,"" says Freddie Davis III, a forester who leads the Rural Training and Research Center, which is part of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives. 
Mr Davis believes that biomass is the best option on such low-value holdings for these owners - who typically live away from their forest land and often not even in the same state. ""I'm super passionate about it because it offers opportunity,"" he says.
Yet the racial justice aspect is complex. Sherri White-Williamson, who leads environmental justice policy for the North Carolina Conservation Network, works out of a cramped office in Clinton. The area has a large black population and is about 20 minutes away from a pellet mill. ""We've pretty much become the dumping ground for a lot of things for the sake of economic development,"" she says. 
While the wood pellet industry is an important local employer, Ms White-Williamson argues that the effects on water, air and noise mean that these companies aren't the best of neighbours. 
Volatile organic compounds from wood pellet manufacture, especially softwood like pine, are a problem because of the way they're converted into formaldehyde and other noxious substances, says Derb S Carter Junior, a lawyer at the Southern Environmental Law Center. 
Enviva, the world's main producer of wood pellets, counters that its plants are in compliance with air quality regulations. 
Biomass is controversial, not just locally for the effects on communities near pellet plants, but also globally for the unusual way that its carbon emissions are counted. Many argue that the current carbon accounting rules on wood pellets are not fit for purpose. 
They are accounted at the harvest site, such as in North Carolina, rather than the place where they are actually burnt, notably at the UK's Drax power station in Yorkshire. 
The reason for this is that because the trees are replanted, this form of energy is renewable. Decades ago, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) agreed under the Kyoto Protocol that it would be simpler to account for the carbon emissions of land use only when harvested.
But these decisions have been not just scientific but political, says Peg Putt, who coordinates biomass campaigns for the Environmental Paper Network: The negotiators mainly ""come out of the forest agencies of the various countries, have close ties to industry and work to advantage the interests of the forest industry,"" she argues.
""They have made the accounting seem so forbiddingly complicated and technical that higher level negotiators in the party delegations just leave it to them."" 
More technology of business:
Lawyer Derb Carter says the US now has a ""proliferation"" of wood pellet mills ""where - they're all for export, mostly to Europe - and essentially no utilisation of this material here in the US for energy production"".
In 2018-19, all of the wood pellets fed into the UK's Drax power station were imported. Mr Carter says for the EU, UK, and increasingly Japan and South Korea, this system is ""almost a free ticket in some ways"". 
The emissions from burning wood don't actually show up in these countries' emissions records, because of what he says are the ""perverse accounting"" rules on wood pellets' carbon emissions.
A growing number of scientists and policymakers understand that biomass is not an instantaneously carbon-neutral source of renewable energy. Mr Carter says it is a ""simplistic notion"" that trees are a renewable resource. Trees cut for biomass can take 30-100 years to fully grow back. Even if they store some carbon as they grow - the maximum amount of carbon dioxide is only absorbed by fully mature trees.
Drax defends it use of wood chips to make electricity.
""Biomass is a reliable, flexible renewable power source which is available regardless of what the weather does. It therefore has a vital role to play in the energy system, displacing coal and supporting the grid to further decarbonise, by enabling more renewables like wind and solar to come online,"" a spokesperson said.  
Wood pellet producer Enviva points out it is not sourcing from pristine forests, but managed forests which need to be thinned periodically to maintain good health, yet whose wood quality isn't high enough for higher-value markets like paper. 
According to Enviva, its wood pellet mix is made up of 20% sawmill residues, 14% thinning, and the remainder from harvest.
Kim Cesafsky, Enviva's director of sustainability, is adamant that ""we directly displace coal"". She calls fossil fuels ""a one-way street"", in contrast to biomass.
Yet biomass is actually even more polluting than coal. ""Burning wood for energy produces at least as much carbon dioxide as burning coal per unit of energy produced and usually more,"" Ms Putt explains.
Wood is less energy dense than coal, so ""you have to put more into burning it to get the amount of energy that you want - therefore you release, generally, more carbon dioxide,"" she says. 
Prof Gert-Jan Nabuurs, who researches forestry at Wageningen University, the Netherlands, is one of the coordinating lead authors of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). He acknowledges that wood does not burn as efficiently as natural gas or coal ""and that is why for the same amount of energy, you are emitting more"". But he argues that ""this biomass for bioenergy is a short cycle"" as the trees are replanted.
Yet this idea runs contrary to proforestation - the principle of keeping forests intact - because as diverse forests are replaced with plantations of a single tree species, this makes them not only more vulnerable to disease but also generally less efficient at sequestering carbon. 
According to Ms Putt: ""Plantations are less carbon dense than are natural forests, generally speaking, and they get logged more frequently. So they have less opportunities to sequester carbon.""
The second story on wood pellets in this series will cover how power stations are using biomass to generate electricity and will be published on Friday 14th January.

30,Climate change,Helen Briggs,Veg diet plus re-wilding gives 'double climate dividend',2022-01-10,"One hundred billion tons of carbon dioxide could be removed from the air by the end of the century through veggie diets plus re-wilding farmland.
That's the estimate of a study of potential carbon savings from turning the land freed up to nature.
A quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food and agriculture, with livestock accounting for the bulk, in rich nations.
And the animals need a huge amount of land for grazing and growing feed.
If wealthier countries moved away from meat-rich diets, much less land would be needed to grow food, and vast areas could be left to revert to their natural state, with wild plants and trees drawing down carbon from the atmosphere, a study found.
This ""double climate dividend"" could be achieved through linking land, food, public health and climate policy.
""It's a double whammy,"" said Dr Paul Behrens of Leiden University in The Netherlands, who led the research.
""We know that shifting diets can save a huge amount of emissions from avoiding emissions from animal-based agriculture, but we can also save large amounts of land which can be used to sequester carbon from the atmosphere.""
The researchers estimated the effect of a shift to a diet with a bit of meat but a lot of veg by more than 50 high-income nations.
They estimate this ""planetary health diet"" would reduce annual agricultural production emissions by almost two-thirds, while allowing former farmland to return to its natural state would remove 98.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by the end of the century (about 14 years' worth of total global emissions from agriculture). 
""Another way to think about it is that you could roughly double the emissions that you save by following a plant-based diet if the land was allowed to re-wild or re-forest,"" Dr Behrens said.
There's a growing realisation that climate change and nature are inextricably linked and must be tackled together.
 ""It's really about having a joined-up picture of food policy and land policy and climate policy at the same time and fundamentally re-aligning subsidies in order to harness this,"" he added.
The study is published in Nature Food.
In England, farmers and landowners could be paid to turn large areas of land into nature reserves, or to restore floodplains, under new government agriculture subsidies.

31,Climate change,Georgina Rannard,Past seven years hottest on record - EU satellite data,2022-01-10,"The past seven years have been the hottest on record, according to new data from the EU's satellite system.
The Copernicus Climate Change Service said 2021 was the fifth-warmest year, with record-breaking heat in some regions.
And the amount of warming gases in our atmosphere continued to increase. 
Governments are committed to limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C to curb climate change. But scientists warn that time is fast running out.
The environmental, human and economic costs of hotter temperatures are already being seen globally. 
Europe lived through its warmest summer, and temperature records in western US and Canada were broken by several degrees. Extreme wildfires in July and August burnt almost entire towns to the ground and killed hundreds. 
""These events are a stark reminder of the need to change our ways, take decisive and effective steps toward a sustainable society and work towards reducing net carbon emissions,"" Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, explains.
The Copernicus data comes from a constellation of Sentinel satellites that monitor the Earth from orbit, as well as measurements taken at ground level.
Copernicus data showed that 2021 was the fifth-hottest on record, marginally warmer than 2015 and 2018. Taken together, the past seven years were the hottest seven years on record by a clear margin, the agency explained.
The 2021 average temperature was 1.1-1.2C above the pre-industrial level around 150 years ago.
It would be easy to dismiss the latest global temperature figure as a non-event. Who celebrates fifth place in anything? 
If we were in a film, these annual temperature updates would be the ominous drum beat signalling the plot is darkening. 
They measure out the pace of change in our world. The increments may be tiny - a fraction of a degree - but the direction of travel is inescapable.  
And make no mistake, the rhythm they mark out increasingly sets the pace for all our lives.  Think of the fires and floods that affected so many people in 2021.
And now look again at what the data is telling us: the seven hottest years ever recorded have been the last seven years.
We can't say we weren't warned. 
The agency said that the start of the year saw relatively low temperatures compared to recent years, but that by June monthly temperatures were at least among the warmest four recorded.
Places with above average temperatures included the west coast of US and Canada, north-east Canada and Greenland, large parts of north and central Africa, and the Middle East. 
The weather phenomenon known as La NiÃ±a - when surface sea temperatures are cooler - contributed to below-average temperatures in western and eastern Siberia, Alaska, and the central and eastern Pacific during the start and end of 2021.
Overall Europe's annual temperature was outside the ten warmest years on record but the summer was the hottest.
A heatwave swept through Mediterranean in July and August, particularly affecting Greece, Spain and Italy.
In Sicily, 48.8C degrees was reported, breaking Europe's record for highest temperature by 0.8C. 
The hot temperatures in the eastern and central Mediterranean was followed by intense wildfires particular in Turkey but also in Greece, Italy, Tunisia and Algeria.
And Europe also saw extreme wet weather, with huge floods devastating parts of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.
These events were part of the same picture of weather systems disrupted by climate change.
The concentration in the earth's atmosphere of two gases that significantly contribute to climate change rose in 2021, said Copernicus. 
Carbon dioxide concentrations reached 414.3 parts per million last year, growing at a similar rate to 2020. 
This video can not be played
But scientists remarked that methane levels in the atmosphere increased to reach an unprecedented approximately 1,876 parts per billion. The growth rate of methane was also higher than in 2020 - Copernicus said both rates were very high compared to the past two decades of satellite data.
Scientist say it is important to reduce methane levels because it is more potent than CO2, however it lasts much less time in the Earth's atmosphere.
The increasing concentrations of these gases showed no signs of slowing down, concluded Vincent-Henri Peuch, Director of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service.
More data about 2021's temperatures will be released in the coming days from other agencies including from Nasa and the UK's Met Office.

32,COP26,BBC News,Deforestation: Aberystwyth Uni satellite maps show global impact,2022-01-10,"Maps showing the extent of global deforestation from space have been made to help save the planet.
Aberystwyth University scientists used satellite data to make images showing how the world's forests have changed in the last decade.
The maps highlight the impact of chopping down trees in places like the Amazon. 
They also show the effect of bush fires in Australia and larch disease in the UK.
The work is being published as part of a European Space Agency project run by the Aberystwyth team.
Trees are considered vital in the fight against climate change as they soak up carbon dioxide and store it in their trunks, branches and roots.
The scientists said their research would allow the estimation of global carbon stocks.
The maps are set to be published online and exhibited at Machynlleth's Centre for Alternative Technology.
Prof Richard Lucas, of Aberystwyth University's earth observation group, said the information should be used ""to prevent further losses of forest integrity"".
He said: ""We are ensuring this data becomes available to all interested and relevant stakeholders, including the public, to inform and drive proactive responses.""
The team's work was showcased at Glasgow's COP26 climate summit where over 100 countries signed a pledge to try and end deforestation by 2030.
Aberystwyth University's Heather Kay said the team's data would ""provide key information on whether these targets are being met"".

33,Climate change,Roger Harrabin,"Energy bills: Fix insulation to tackle cost of heating, PM told",2022-01-10,"Better insulation could save UK households more than Â£500 a year on energy bills, according to a group of business organisations and charities.
The Energy Efficiency Infrastructure Group is calling on the prime minister to prioritise energy saving through home improvements.
It could save the UK Â£7.8bn a year, the group says.
The government is under political pressure to take action over rocketing gas bills.
Households have seen energy bills rise in recent months and further increases will take effect in April, when the energy price cap will be raised to take higher wholesale gas prices into account.
The government is exploring ways to support those on low incomes who will struggle to afford higher heating costs. 
But the EEIG, which includes the CBI, Kingfisher, Energy Savings Trust and the green group WWF, says this and previous administrations are partly to blame for higher bills because they failed to ensure Britain's homes are adequately insulated.
""The cost-of-living crisis is being driven by soaring gas prices,"" said EEIG chairwoman Sarah Kostense-Winterton. ""A permanent solution to lower bills is by reducing demand through energy efficiency measures. 
""Emergency short-term measures for the most vulnerable households are crucial, but it's fundamental for the government to simultaneously focus on the long term to avoid futures crises. 
""Green home retrofits have significant social, environmental and economic co-benefits, and stand out as a 'no regrets' solution to the energy crisis, climate crisis, and levelling up agenda."" 
Britain has the coldest and leakiest housing stock in western Europe, leaving residents particularly exposed to spikes in gas prices.
Successive governments have failed to implement policies to tackle the problem. The most recent insulation scheme, the Green Homes Grant, was scrapped after just six months.
The chancellor was urged by backbench MPs to use last autumn's Budget to introduce a multi-year energy efficiency programme, but he declined.
In the short term the EEIG wants the government to provide additional support for vulnerable households to prevent a fuel poverty emergency.
This would include expanding the Warm Homes Discount, an option the government is discussing.
But the EEIG insists that ministers must also bolster the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) which requires energy suppliers to help low-income households to fit energy-saving measures.
The group fears that the chancellor may suspend the long-term ECO funding and shift the cash to tackle the immediate bills problem instead.
The EEIG is warning that cutting ECO would be damaging for households and industry, and would stall progress in making fuel-poor homes more energy efficient, risking green jobs and keeping households hooked on expensive gas.
In his manifesto Boris Johnson promised Â£9bn for energy efficiency up to 2030.
About Â£6bn was allocated to be spent this parliament but the EEIG says money not allocated amounts to a broken promise.
The EEIG is also calling for a new Â£3.6bn grant or subsidy scheme to help all households, including private owners, to insulate their homes. 
At the moment, the EEIG maintains, two-thirds of households have no financial support for insulation, even though insulation is a vital part of the strategy to cut carbon emissions. 
The insulation call was backed at the weekend by MPs on the Conservative Environment Network.
A government spokesman said it had already made huge progress in upgrading the energy efficiency of England's homes - from 9% rated grade C in 2008, to 40% today.
He said all new heating systems installed in UK homes from 2035 will be low-carbon technologies, like heat pumps or hydrogen-ready boilers. This will be a gradual, 14-year transition, and to cut the cost of heat pump, we're offering grants to households worth Â£5,000.
He added: ""Improving energy efficiency is the best long term solution to tackling fuel poverty, which is why we are supporting households across the UK to improve their energy performance and reduce bills, having already invested Â£1.3bn this year alone to upgrade up to 50,000 homes. 
""The Energy Price Cap will remain in place, shielding millions of customers from rising global gas prices, and we are continuing to support lower-income households through Â£4.2bn in support, including the Home Upgrade Grant, Energy Company Obligation and the new Â£500m Household Support Fund.""

34,Climate change,Nia Cerys,Snowdonia hydro schemes reach production milestone,2022-01-04,"A renewable energy project in Snowdonia has produced 20 million kWh of energy over eight years.
That's enough energy to power 5,300 homes for a year.
The National Trust-run project hopes the turbines will help it reach a carbon zero target by 2030.
General manager Trystan Edwards said when the project started in 2013 it was new so they relied on outside expertise to get started. It's now helping others develop their own hydro schemes.
""We're not a company that has been involved in generating electricity, we're a conservation charity and so it was a very new departure for us,"" added Mr Edwards.
""So in that sense it was challenging trying to make sure we weren't going to build something that was detrimental to the habitat or the landscape.  
""We put a lot of faith in the experts and what time has shown is that those experts were really close to the mark."" 
In total, the National Trust's group of turbines have produced enough energy to power 5,300 homes for a year, which it had predicted at the start of the project.
Mr Edwards said: ""A lot of the electricity generated is exported to the grid which means we get income from the sale of electricity.
""That income is ploughed back into conservation work, keeping our building stock in good condition, keeping slates on some of our older buildings. 
""This means we've been able to keep contractors and other local employment going. 
""That's been a key part of the success story that we're keen to support.""
The hydros also provide an insight into climate change as energy production fluctuates according to the weather.
""The wettest month we've been able to record in terms of generation was when Storm Desmond came through in December 2015 and the driest period was when we had the start of the Covid lockdown in April and May 2020 - a really long, dry period. 
""What we then see is a period of quite heavy rain coming in and sometimes at times of the year you wouldn't expect,"" said Mr Edwards.
""It's been interesting for us to look at the charts, look at the generation data and come up with our own analysis really of how it's impacting a farmed environment like this and how we need to react to that in terms of how we manage assets like hydros.""
At the hydro site in Hafod y Llan the pipeline is buried in the hillside so there is minimal visual impact on the landscape.
The dam - or weir - among the nearby abandoned copper mines diverts part of the mountain river overflow to the turbine on the Trust's valley farm in Hafod y Llan.
Consultancy manager Paul Southall oversaw the Snowdonia project with the charity.
""There was lots of debate and discussions about it was the right thing, the right place,"" he said.
He believes now that the results achieved are ""perfect"".
""We couldn't really have done it any better or in any more aesthetically-sensitive way, both visually but also in an ecological and environmental sense.  
""It wasn't just the what we've done, but the how we've done it. 
""So following this, we go out and we've worked with two or three communities to develop their own community hydro schemes in the local area. 
""We're looking at how farms can diversify and renewables is part of that mix.  
""So in the broader sense it's the how we can teach, how we can share, how we can inspire people.""

35,Climate change,BBC News,Thunderstorm alert over for south and east England,2022-01-02,"A Yellow weather alert for thunderstorms, which brought heavy showers and high winds to the south and east of England, has come to an end.
""A band of thunderstorms"" moved across England on Sunday, with the Met Office warning of ""localised disruption"" and difficult driving conditions.
It follows unseasonably warm weather over the new year.
Saturday marked the warmest New Year's Day on record, reaching 16.3C (61.3F) in London's St James's Park.
The original yellow warning, issued mid-morning on Sunday, encompassed a wide swathe of south and south west England, as well Cardiff, Monmouthshire and Newport in Wales - but the warning was later updated to focus on a smaller affected area in the south and east of England only.
There had been fears about damage to trees and buildings, or disruption to train and road travel but they appear to have come to nothing - although several flood warnings remain in place due to the significant rainfall causing some rivers to overflow.
A Met Office tweet said it would be ""another mild evening"" but with ""some blustery winds at times"". Showers are expected to work their way eastwards ""perhaps with hail and the odd thunderstorm in places"".
On Friday, Britain saw its warmest ever recorded New Year's Eve with temperatures reaching 15.8C (60.4F) in Merryfield, Somerset.
The Met Office said the extremely mild spell was driven by a flow of warm, moist air from the Canary Islands.
But climate change is also a factor: warm weather records are being broken nine times more frequently, according to the Met Office - a clear sign of an over-heating planet, according to BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin.
Globally, climate change has driven temperatures up by 1.1C. In recent days, the US reported dramatic winter wildfires in Colorado - halted by sudden, heavy snowfall - while the state of Alaska recorded its hottest-ever December day at the end of last month.
The Met Office said the weather across the UK was forecast to get cooler from Tuesday, potentially bringing wintry showers and frosts.
BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker said, following the ""extraordinarily mild weather"", it is set to turn colder and temperatures would be ""closer to the norm for the time of year"" - with temperatures expected to be below freezing in Scotland and Northern Ireland by early Tuesday.
Most of the UK would continue to have above average temperatures, he said, warning of low pressure and an approaching weather front bringing ""a little bit of sleet and snow"" to some northern parts of the UK by Monday.

Each have differing targets, with Climate Change Bill No. 1 proposing to reach Net Zero by 2045. 
The private member's bill from Green Party leader Clare Bailey is viewed as more ambitious than No. 2.
The second one, brought by the Agriculture and Environment Minister Edwin Poots, sets a target of an 82% reduction in emissions by 2050 - a figure aligned with what the Climate Change Committee says is possible given our reliance on agriculture. 
A short-lived bid to find a compromise between the two bills foundered in the autumn, and it remains to be seen which, if either, will cross the legislative finish line before this assembly's mandate ends in March.  
Farmers watched the goings-on at Stormont warily.
Some fear what any legislation will mean for herd numbers and methods of farming here. But amid the uncertainty, most acknowledge that the only thing they are sure of is that change is coming in 2022.

It was the size of 365 rugby pitches, and devastated flora and fauna in the area of outstanding natural beauty, at a time of year when many birds and wildlife species were laying eggs and rearing young at ground level.
A plan to close the controversial Renewable Heat Incentive scheme and compensate owners was unveiled.
It proposed buying out participants at a total cost of around Â£68m - a prospect not welcomed by boiler owners. The consultation on closure and compensation closed in April and has yet to report back.
In November, the UK played host to the climate change conference, COP26.  
It saw a flurry of high-level agreements and side deals to tackle rising temperatures and their potentially catastrophic effects.  
There were agreements on the ""phase-down"" of coal, stopping and reversing deforestation, and increasing the use of electric vehicles. Taken far above our heads perhaps, but still relevant to Northern Ireland - for example, we are one of the most deforested parts of Europe, with just 8% of woodland cover.  
Schemes to redress that balance are already underway, with a new forest of native trees being planted in the hills above Belfast, and a One Million Trees programme putting saplings around the city. 
The largest ever outbreak of bird flu in the UK began in October. 
As cases spread in Great Britain, a protection zone was established in Northern Ireland.
Cases were identified in wild birds at the Waterworks in Belfast in November. The highly pathogenic disease was detected in three commercial flocks and a backyard flock in counties Tyrone and Antrim from November into December. 
Thousands of ducks and poultry have been culled. The minister said the compensation bill could run in to ""tens of millions"" of pounds.  
As the year drew to a close, a new energy strategy happened with a whimper rather than a bang, on one of the final pre-Christmas meeting days for the executive.  
It will be followed by an action plan early in the new year, officials said, with a ""significant"" pilot scheme to transform our home heating already planned.
This year will be another year of environmental focus. 
The proposals from COP26, if fully delivered on, only reduce global warming to just under 2C, which could still wipe some island nations and low-lying coastal areas off the map.  
Northern Ireland's contribution to reducing that impact has yet to be decided, but there will be a contribution, with changes and consequences for us all.

37,COP26,BBC News,EU plans to label gas and nuclear energy 'green' prompt row,2022-01-02,"The European Commission has proposed plans to label some gas and nuclear power as green, prompting criticism from Germany. 
The proposal argues that gas and nuclear are key to helping transition to cleaner power. 
But Germany's environment minister called the plan ""absolutely wrong"".
It comes months after countries pledged to keep temperature rises within 1.5C at the COP26 climate summit. 
""It is necessary to recognise that the fossil gas and nuclear energy sectors can contribute to the decarbonisation of the Union's economy,"" the Commission's proposal says. 
Under the proposal, only gas and nuclear plants with the highest standards would be considered green. Nuclear plants would also have to have strict waste disposal plans, Deutsche Welle reports. While gas plants would have a limit of how much carbon dioxide is released per kilowatt-hour of energy produced. 
If a majority of EU members back the proposal then it will become law from 2023. 
France had reportedly pushed for nuclear power to be included. The country relies on nuclear energy for 70% of its electricity, although this will be cut to half over the next 15 years. 
France has also pledged to reduce its reliance on nuclear power by shutting down 12 nuclear reactors by 2035. 
The move has been criticised by Germany, which is in the process of phasing out nuclear completely and only has a few plants remaining.
German Environment Minister Steffi Lemke described the proposal as ""wrong"", adding that nuclear energy could lead to environmental disasters and large amounts of nuclear waste. 
Economy and Climate Protection Minister Robert Habeck called the plan ""greenwashing"", saying it ""waters down the good label for sustainability.""

38,COP26,BBC News,Denmark to make domestic flights fossil fuel free by 2030,2022-01-02,"Denmark's government has announced a goal to make domestic flights fossil fuel free by 2030. 
In her New Year's address, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she wanted to ""make flying green"". 
However she acknowledged that the solutions to reach her target were not yet in place.
Denmark is aiming for a 70% cut in overall carbon emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.
""To travel is to live and therefore we fly,"" said Ms Frederiksen, announcing her plan.
""When other countries in the world are too slow, then Denmark must take the lead and raise the bar even more,"" she said. 
She added that achieving green domestic flights would be difficult but researchers and companies were working on solutions. 
The European manufacturer Airbus has announced plans to develop hydrogen-fuelled planes that could be operational by 2035. 
If the hydrogen used to fuel them is generated using renewable energy, this could be a way for Denmark to reach its goals. 
However it is unclear if the technology will be ready, and costs sufficiently low, for the 2030 target to be reached.
Sweden has also announced plans to make its domestic flights fossil fuel-free by 2030. It is also hoping to make international flights green by 2045. 
Earlier this year, the government there announced plans to introduce increased airport fees for high-polluting planes. 
Meanwhile France is moving to ban domestic flights where the same journey could be made by train in under two-and-a-half hours. 
The measures could affect travel between Paris and cities including Nantes, Lyon and Bordeaux.

41,Our Planet Now,Justin Rowlatt,California's fires threaten to ravage mighty sequoia forests,2022-01-01,"California's giant sequoias are symbols of permanence - with some living for thousands of years. But the fierce wildfires ravaging the state threaten even these mighty trees, which are among the longest-lived organisms on Earth.
There is something primeval about giant sequoias. Their weird, broccoli-like branches wouldn't seem out of place with a long-necked dinosaur plodding by. 
And they are impossibly big: 30 or 40 people would have to link hands to hug the largest ones. The tallest trees are 90m (295ft) high. That's like a 30-storey tower block.
""They make you feel deep time"", sighs Christy Bingham, as she looks up at the biggest tree in the world - known as the General Sherman. 
""You can just sense standing here that this tree was born before Jesus."" 
Christy lowers her voice as she says this, as if out of respect. She's in charge of conserving these magnificent trees in the Sequoia National Park in the Sierra Nevada mountains - their last redoubt.
Sequoias live so long because they are exquisitely adapted to their environment, Christy tells me. 
There have always been fires in California and, in response, sequoias have developed insulating bark which can be up to a metre thick and which stops all but the hottest fires damaging the trees. 
But California's fires are changing. Christy leads me deeper into the forest, to show me what she means.
All you can hear is the sound of the wind in the leaves, the occasional cry of a raven and our footsteps crunching in the leaf litter. It is heaven. Until, that is, we walk over a ridge and the scene changes dramatically.
""This is what I wanted to show you, this was a giant sequoia grove"", she says. The landscape is monochrome now: grey or black, ash or cinders. Many of the huge trees have been reduced to columns of charcoal.
""Before 2015 no one saw a sequoia that looked like this,"" says Christy. She is crying now. ""You never saw a tree become a candle and burn up in this way before."" She points to the blackened remains of one of the biggest trees. 
""This 1,000- to 2,000-year-old tree should have lived another 500 to 800 years but it's gone."" 
Christy wipes her tears with the sleeve of her jacket. ""It will not sequester any more carbon. It will not be a spotted owl house. It's dead.""
It isn't just California's trees that have been suffering. Several hours' drive north we visit the Gold Rush-era town of Greenville. It used to be famous for its Wild West-style clapboard shops and its white painted church with its elegant wooden spire. 
All that is gone now, incinerated in the massive Dixie Fire this summer which burnt a million acres and cost some 600 million dollars to fight.
Nichoel Farris tells me how she got a text telling her to get out of town. An hour later the whole place - 1,500 buildings in total - had been erased, and her ""forever home"" with it.
""It took all the colour out of my life. Look, everything is just a shade of grey"", says Nichoel, gesturing towards the ashes of her house. ""We lost the future we'd planned for and built."" She's crying now. ""We lost our story"", she tells me.
But Nichoel hasn't lost all hope. She talks about how she wants to see the town rebuilt using the latest fire protection knowhow. She and her husband grew 80% of their food on their land and she hopes others will do the same. 
""Greenville could actually be a lighthouse community of sustainability and climate adaptation. And how we live in our new normal - because big fires are now the new normal,"" she says.
And, in the forest, Christy hasn't given up hope either. She expects to see baby sequoias sprouting here next year. They like burnt soil. And she says the forests need to be better managed, with dead wood and brush that can fuel fires cleared away.
What's more, a few of the trees, even here amongst the destruction, will survive. Christy starts to scrape with her fingers at the charred bark of a giant sequoia at the very edge of the grove. 
Not far in - about an inch or a couple of centimetres - and the charcoal gives way to reddish bark. ""This is just surface damage,"" she says. ""Look up at the leaves, lots of them have survived. This tree will live!""
The resilience of the sequoias should inspire us, says Christy: ""It is telling us we need to act on climate change now and that every little bit counts"". She turns to look me in the eye. 
""Every carbon reduction will help these forests persist,"" she says. And I notice her smile has returned as we walk on through the trees.

42,Climate change,BBC News,Colorado wildfires: Tens of thousands evacuated as blazes spread,2021-12-31,"Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated and nearly 1,000 homes have been destroyed as wildfires spread through the US state of Colorado.
The fast-moving blazes are burning in Boulder County, north of Denver. Governor Jared Polis called it a ""New Year's Eve miracle"" that no deaths had been reported.
Some 30,000 people in the towns of Louisville and Superior were told to leave their homes on Thursday.
A state of emergency has been declared.
""It was in blink of an eye. This was a disaster in fast motion, all in the course of half a day,"" Governor Polis said in a news conference on Friday.
""Nearly 1,000 homes are gone,"" he added.
Winds of up to 105 mph (169 km/h) are fanning flames across the region amid a historic drought.
While previous fires in Colorado have been in rural areas, these latest blazes are burning in more suburban parts of the state. Thursday's fires, named the Marshall Fire and Middle Fork Fire, are coming relatively late in the season. 
At least some were sparked when power lines were toppled by strong winds, and they have quickly become the most destructive wildfires in the state's modern history. Experts say that wildfires in western North America have grown more intense in recent years. 
""This is our community so to watch it burn so quickly, so unexpectedly, is something that we are struggling to understand,"" said Gov Polis, who added that President Joe Biden had called to say he would sign a federal emergency declaration.
Some 370 homes went up in flames west of Superior and 210 were lost in the Old Town area of Superior, Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said.
A shopping complex and hotel were also destroyed, and about 6,000 acres were burned in total, the sheriff said. 
Snow had began falling near the fires on Friday morning, offering some reprieve to firefighters who say the remaining fires are expected to burn out shortly.
Neither of the two major hospitals in the area were affected, and all schools were ""spared"" from the flames, added Gov Polis. 
At least one first responder and six others were injured, Sheriff Pelle said, adding that more casualties were likely. 
One video taken outside a supermarket showed a dramatic scene as winds ripped through the car park.
Patrick Kilbride, 72, was at work in a hardware store when he heard the order to evacuate, The Denver Post reported. 
He rushed home but only had time to gather a few possessions before the flames engulfed the property. His pet dog and cat both died. 
""It's just a strange feeling to go from having everything to make your life comfortable to having nothing,"" he said.
Colorado has been experiencing extreme droughts in recent years. Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.
The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

43,Climate change,BBC News,Scotland's 100% renewables electricity target narrowly missed,2021-12-31,"Scotland narrowly missed a key environment target for the equivalent of 100% of electricity used in 2020 to be generated from renewable sources.
Official figures show gross consumption from renewables - minus net exports - was 98.6%
The full 2020 total was up from 97.4% in the early part of the year. 
It comes after the Scottish government missed a target for 11% of non-electrical heat to be generated by renewables in 2020.
Energy Secretary Michael Matheson said the country continued to ""lead the way"" with its commitment to be net zero by 2045.
In 2019, Scotland met 90.1% of its equivalent electricity consumption from renewables, according to Scottish government figures.
The 100% target was set in 2011, when renewable technologies generated just 37% of national demand.
Some of Scotland's electricity is sold overseas, meaning it also uses significant amounts of non-renewable electricity.
The latest full-year figures also showed:
Over the first nine months of 2021, provisional figures show generation was down 22.3% compared  with the same period in 2020.
The Scottish government said this was ""mainly due to continued mild weather over the year adversely affecting hydro and wind generation"".
According to the Energy Statistics for Scotland, electricity consumption also dropped by 5.7% from 2019 to 2020.
However, gas consumption rose slightly by 2.4% on 2019.
Scotland has some of the most ambitious climate targets in the world, with its Climate Change Bill setting out a legally-binding target of reaching net-zero emissions by 2045.
By 2030, ministers want renewable energy generation to account for 50% of energy demand across electricity, heat and transport.
Michael Matheson said he was ""proud of the progress Scotland has made over the past year"".
The energy secretary added: ""This statement shows we are continuing to make good progress with the equivalent of 98.6% of gross electricity consumption being from renewable sources in 2020, which is up from 89.8% in 2019.
""Whilst we do have many challenges ahead of us if we are going to meet our ambitious targets, we have laid the groundwork in 2021 for Scotland to take important leaps forward towards net zero.""

45,COP26,Martin Webber,Business Review of 2021: Climate change and Covid,2021-12-30,"Over the past year governments all over the world told businesses to radically step up their strategies for going green and shifting away from fossil fuels. 
The Glasgow COP 26 Climate Conference in November saw the host, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, setting out why humanity had to ""act now"".
Mr Johnson declared: ""If we don't get serious about climate change today, it will be too late for our children to do so tomorrow"".  
After the two weeks of talking in Glasgow, a draft deal pledging to ""phase out"" use of the dirtiest fuel, coal, was rejected by the biggest coal users, China and India.
But climate experts welcomed the fact that a reference to coal did stay in the final agreement, with a commitment instead to ""phase down"" coal use.  
Many established business leaders have already got the message and some have already completely changed what they do.  
The Australian mining entrepreneur, Andrew Forrest, the CEO of Fortescue Metals Group, told the BBC how his firm's large iron ore trucks and trains were being converted to so-called ""green hydrogen"".  
To make ""green hydrogen"", renewable energy - like wind power - is used to create electricity that then splits water into oxygen and hydrogen.  That hydrogen is captured to use as a fuel. In a hydrogen engine, the main emission is harmless water vapour.  
""This is the day the fossil fuel industry has denied would come. There are huge sources of green hydrogen - if the world bothers to make the transition. My own company is making the transition right now,"" he said.  
The entrepreneur said he took a four year PhD to study the environment and had learned that ""global warming is frighteningly real.""    
In April he took Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, to his vast mining operations that dig out iron ore to make the world's steel.  
Mr Forrest described how the prime minister faced ""big beefy Australian workers"" who would put an arm round Mr Morrison, saying ""come on ScoMo we're all going green, what's taking you so long? Green is the future mate"". 
A few months after that visit, Scott Morrison committed to making Australia ""net-zero"" by 2050 in line with the US, Japan, the EU and UK. 
""Net zero"" means that any climate damaging emissions are offset by emissions that are removed from the environment. 
China, Russia and Saudi Arabia are focussing on a 2060 ""net zero"" target. India's target is 2070. 
Meanwhile, in Denmark, green hydrogen is being created at a site at Brande in Jutland in the west of the country, using rows of dedicated wind turbines that tower over the countryside.  
The hydrogen is then used to fuel the vehicles of a nearby green taxi firm called DRIVR, which have chosen the hydrogen option over battery electric taxis. 
""In the taxi industry, the most important thing is time,"" Haydar Shaiwandi, chief executive of DRIVR told us. 
""We can't charge electric vehicles fast. The hydrogen vehicles actually act like regular diesel vehicles because for recharging a hydrogen vehicle is a maximum of five minutes.""  
But while change is happening, many say it is not happening fast enough.  
One big concern is that the green option is usually still the more expensive one, so most businesses still put their cash into cheaper but polluting investments. 
The fear is that without more decisive government action to change economic incentives, business and investors won't be able to deliver on the pledges set out by their nation's political leaders. 
Among those worried is Tariq Fancy, a former high flyer in the world of sustainable investing. He used to work as chief investment officer for sustainable investing at Blackrock, one of the world's largest asset managers.  
Mr Fancy says that - by law - managers like Blackrock need to maximise future retirement income for their investors. 
He argues that managers can look at environmental considerations but ""can't lose any money by investing in something that's good for the world"" because they are legally prohibited from doing that.
""Little to none of what any of the financial services industry is doing is actually - in any meaningful way - doing anything to fight climate change,"" he says. 
Because of this, he argues that the sector is therefore slower to enact reforms ""that experts are telling us we need to"".  
Mr Fancy concludes: ""All of this is what I call a deadly distraction."" 
The International Energy Agency, which is funded by governments of major western nations, made headlines in 2021 with a stark declaration. 
The IEA said that to meet governments' goal of limiting warming for the planet to an extra 1.5C, then there should be no development of any new fossil fuel fields. 
The IEA's chief energy economist Tim Gould says the world got closer to that scenario at Glasgow but ""we're not there yet"", he says. 
""In our view COP26 was all about setting ambitions. The acid test will be how quickly these are implemented. The time now is to really roll up the sleeves and put these pledges into practice."" 
For many years, Irwin Stelzer from the conservative US think-tank, the Hudson Institute, has supported a tax on carbon to encourage the private sector to invest more in green technology.
""Having waged this battle for a decade now and emerging bloody but unbowed, I would say a straight carbon tax will not pass,"" he tells me.    
But he is watching closely EU plans for a ""border tax"" on imported goods produced using ""dirty fuels"" - such as steel produced in China. 
""The EU may turn out to be one of the engines of progress, which is not its usual role. When they have border taxes, that tax imports for their carbon content, other nations will have to respond with similar taxes that will have the same effect."" 
The US will end up with its own border tax as well, Irwin Stelzer says: ""The politics is now falling in place to have some form of carbon pricing - directly or indirectly.""  
While policymakers were focussing on the long term in 2021, they also had a major job shoring up spending in the short term as the Covid pandemic hit activity for a second year. 
Most of the worst forecasts for the impact of Covid on jobs and incomes did not materialise.  Indeed most economies saw output return to levels seen before the pandemic. 
And by the end of 2021, there was growing concern about inflation set off by governments and consumers spending too much.  
Prices in the US are now 7% higher than a year ago - the fastest inflation rate since 1982.  
Ken Rogoff, former chief economist at the IMF, blames Covid-related supply chain issues in part, but says poor US government policy is also to blame.
""The stimulus - the American Rescue Plan - that the government put into place just after President Biden took office was just not well thought out or well designed.  It was throwing money at the economy - too much, too late,"" he says. 
""Frankly what they are doing now with infrastructure and social infrastructure would have done better to do back then."" 
For the big tech giants, it was another profitable year. Shares of the electric car firm, Tesla, rose 40%. Shares of Facebook (now known as Meta) were still up 20% despite a deluge of bad publicity after a former employee released internal documents.  
Frances Haugen said Facebook's own research had shown evidence of Instagram's harmful effects on some teenagers, and that the firm prioritised ""growth over safety"".  
Facebook said the leaks were misleading and said it had 40,000 people working on safety and security. 
Thanks to Covid, small business owners had a bleak time for much of 2021. But many of those that have survived now feel optimistic.  
The owner of the Aroma speciality coffee shop in Bologna in Italy, Cristina Caroli, was overcome with joy when tourists returned last summer.  
""It was literally a dream when we saw the first tourist after so long,"" she says. 
""Somebody speaking another language. It was very emotional. Americans! I couldn't believe it - then the English, the Swiss, the Germans - it was incredible it was fantastic!"" 
Cristina's enthusiasm for the future of her cafÃ© remains undimmed, telling me: ""Activities are starting again, the situation looks really better, it's a kind of renaissance after this bad period.""

46,Climate change,Geeta Pandey,Why I switched to eating grandma's food,2021-12-30,"During my childhood visits to my ancestral home in rural Uttar Pradesh in northern India, I would often find my grandmother eating roti - flat bread - made with pearl millets or sorghum. 
She would mix the flour with water, take a chunk of the dough and beat it between her palms to make a big flat disc and then cook it on the wood-fired clay oven.
If she offered it to me, I'd turn my nose up. I couldn't comprehend why she'd choose them over thinner, tastier, easier-to-eat wheat rotis.
But a few years back, I switched to the food my grandma ate. 
I replaced wheat flour in my kitchen with flour made from pearl millets after I saw a report that said that the latter were healthier.
Even though my roti is now more chewy, I've stuck to it because it makes me feel healthier.
And I'm not alone - agriculture experts say in recent years, many ""forgotten foods"" are making a comeback in the farms and fields and also on our plates.
For a while now, there has been ""a concerted global effort"" to help millets shed their ""forgotten"" tag, says Dr Jacqueline Hughes, Director General of non-profit Icrisat (International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics).
India celebrated 2018 as Year of Millets and in March, the United Nations accepted Delhi's proposal to celebrate 2023 as the International Year of Millets.
Reports say the year would be used to raise awareness about the health benefits of millets and their suitability for cultivation - they can grow in degraded soil and need little pesticide - at a time when the world is confronted with the spectre of global warming.
Millets, Dr Hughes says, are increasingly being recognised as ""smart food"" because ""they are good for the planet, good for the farmer and good for you"".
""They require less water and grow in really hot temperatures. They are good for the farmer because they are very resilient and can survive pestilent diseases. They are good for you because they are more nutritious. Studies show that millets reduce diabetes, improve cholesterol profiles, alleviate calcium, zinc and iron deficiencies. They are also gluten free.""
Not surprising then that health experts in India are looking at millets with interest - the country is home to 80 million diabetics, over 17 million die from cardiovascular diseases every year and more than three million children are malnourished, half of them severely.  
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has talked of ""a millet revolution"" to ""stamp out malnutrition from the country"".
Experts say it's not an impossible task as millets were a staple for Indians for centuries.
Director of Indian Institute of Millet Research Vilas Tonapi says millets are ""the most ancient grains known to mankind"". 
""They were cultivated around 3000BC during the Indus Valley civilisation. Grown in 21 states, there are region and state specific millets which are part of the food culture and religious rituals.""
With the annual yield at 16 million tonnes, India remains the largest producer of millets in the world. But, in the past 50 years, Mr Tonapi says, the area under cultivation has shrunk from 38 million hectares to 13 million hectares and the share of millets in India's food basket has declined from 20% in the 1960s to 6% today.
The decline of millets began in 1969-70, Dr Tonapi says.
""Until then, India used to receive food aid and import large quantities of grains to feed its population. In a bid to attain food sufficiency and alleviate hunger, the government launched green revolution and introduced high-yielding varieties of rice and wheat.""
Between 1960 and 2015 in India, wheat production more than trebled, and rice production increased by 800% while millet production remained stagnant at low levels. 
Dr Hughes, who earlier this year was involved in the preparation of the Global Manifesto for Forgotten Foods, says ""this overemphasis on rice and wheat led to the neglect of millets and many traditional foods that fell by the wayside"". 
""Because they haven't been bred to modern tastes or are not easy to cook in today's fast-paced world, they have been under-utilised and neglected for decades. But it's terribly important to have diversity on your plate,"" she adds.
To do that, the ""forgotten"" crops will have to receive the same sort of attention given to rice and wheat and some of the other commercial crops. Experts say at least a beginning has been made where millets are concerned.
Several strategies suggested by agricultural scientists for their revival have begun to show results - Dr Tonapi says the demand for millets has grown by 146% in the past two years.
Millet cookies, chips, puffs and other munchies are being sold in supermarkets and online stores. The government is offering millets at one rupee a kg to millions through the public distribution system, and some state governments are serving ready-to-eat dishes as part of the school mid-day meal plan.
The renewed interest in coarse grains has come as a blessing for tribal communities in northern districts of Telangana state. 
P Aila is among a group of 10 tribal women in Asifabad who have been trained by Icrisat to prepare meals that are supplied to children in rural day-care centres.
Talking to me on the phone from her village, she lists the ingredients and spices that she uses in the meals and says that in August, they sold 12 tonnes of sweet and savoury dishes made with sorghum.  
Aila doesn't fully understand the interest in the humble grain that's been her staple all her life, but she tells me she's happy that it's going places.

49,COP26,Matt McGrath,Climate change: Hurricanes to expand into more populated regions,2021-12-29,"Climate change will expand the range of tropical cyclones, making millions more people vulnerable to these devastating storms, a new study says.
At present, these cyclones - or hurricanes as they are also known - are mainly confined to the tropical regions north and south of the equator.
But researchers say that rising temperatures will allow these weather events to form in the mid-latitudes. 
This area includes cities such as New York, Beijing, Boston and Tokyo.
The study has been published in the journal Nature Geoscience.
The scientists involved say their work shows by the end of this century, cyclones will likely occur over a wider range than they have for three million years.
When subtropical storm Alpha made landfall in Portugal in September 2020, the relatively small scale of damage caused by the cyclone made few headlines.
But for scientists this was quite a momentous event.
""We hadn't observed this before,"" said Dr Joshua Studholme, a physicist from Yale University.
""You had a traditional kind of mid-latitude storm, that sort of decayed, and in its decay, the right conditions for a tropical cyclone to form occurred, and that hadn't happened to Portugal before.""
Dr Studholme is the lead author of this new study, which projects that a warming climate will see the formation of more of these types of storms in the mid-latitudes, where most of the world's population lives, and where most economic activity takes place.
He explained that as the world gets hotter, the difference in temperature between the equator and polar regions will decline, and this will impact the flow of the jet streams.
Normally, these high-altitude rivers of air act as a kind of border guard for hurricanes, keeping them closer to the equator.
""As the climate warms, that sort of jet stream activity that happens in the middle latitude, will weaken and in extreme cases split, allowing this sort of cyclone formation to occur.""
The question of the impact of human induced climate change on hurricanes has been contentious in the past, but recent research suggests that the connections are becoming clearer.
Last August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published the first part of its sixth assessment report, dealing with the science of a warming climate.
In relation to hurricanes and tropical cyclones, the authors said they had ""high confidence"" that the evidence of human influence has strengthened.
""The proportion of intense tropical cyclones, average peak tropical cyclone wind speeds, and peak wind speeds of the most intense tropical cyclones will increase on the global scale with increasing global warming,"" the IPCC said.
The new research published on Wednesday makes use of multiple strands of evidence to show that tropical cyclones in future are likely to occur over a wider range than previously thought.
""What we've done is make explicit the links between the physics going on within storms themselves and the dynamics of the atmosphere at the planetary scale,"" said Dr Studholme.
""This is a hard problem because this physics isn't well simulated in numerical models run on modern computers."" 
The likely expansion of these storms poses a significant danger to the world, especially when the other impacts of warming come into play.
""Tropical cyclones in the mid-latitude band could experience other changes such as slower motion and heavier rainfall,"" said Dr Gan Zhang, previously an atmospheric scientist at Princeton University and NOAA who wasn't involved in the new paper.
""These tropical cyclone changes, plus pronounced coastal sea level rise might compound potential societal impacts.""
Dr Zhang cautioned that the sensitivity of tropical cyclones to warming has a high level of uncertainty but he said the risk from these storms could still increase even with moderate levels of warming.
Certainly, the authors argue that this course is not set in stone and that dramatic reductions in carbon emissions over the next decade particularly, could alter the outcome.
""The control over this is the temperature gradient between the tropics and the poles, and that's very tightly linked to overall climate change,"" said Dr Studholme.
""By end of this century, the difference in that gradient between a high emission scenario and a low emission scenario is dramatic. That can be very significant in terms of how these hurricanes play out.""

50,Climate change,Jack Hunter,Alaska 'Icemageddon' warning follows heat record,2021-12-29,"The coldest US state of Alaska has recorded its hottest-ever December day, amid an unusual winter warm spell.
Temperatures soared to a record 19.4C (67F) on the island of Kodiak on Sunday - almost seven degrees warmer than the state's previous high.
But elsewhere in Alaska temperatures have been plunging to record lows.
In the south-eastern town of Ketchikan, temperatures dropped to -18C (-0.4F) on 25 December - one of the town's coldest Christmas Days in the past century.
The weather extremes have prompted warnings of an ""Icemageddon"" from authorities, as torrents of rain and snow have left ice as hard as cement coating the roads.
Experts say warm air pouring in from Hawaii has made Alaska's air - usually cold and dry during December - more moist. This has meant heavy rain and snow storms are more likely in interior regions, away from the balmy coastal areas.
Heavy snowfall was followed by torrential rain that left the region coated with ice as the rain quickly froze, resulting in widespread power failures, road closures and offices being shut.
Thick ice formed on roads and made them treacherous for drivers, warned the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities.
""Ice is extremely difficult to remove once it has binded to the road surface. Even though air temps were warm... roads were at sub-zero temps, which caused ice to bind to the surface,"" the department said on Twitter.
The ice would likely cling to the roads until at least March or April, Climate Scientist Rick Thoman, of the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy, told the BBC.
The fiercest mid-winter storm since 1937 struck the central city of Fairbanks over Christmas, dumping more than 10in (25.4cm) of snow, Mr Thoman explained.
So much snow fell on Sunday it caved in the roof of the only grocery shop in the town of Delta Junction, 95 miles (153km) south-east of Fairbanks.
Mr Thoman said the blasts of extreme warm and cold temperatures over the past two decades were a sign of climate change.
""When all the pieces come together in a warming world we're going to get these unprecedented events, that's what we expect,"" he said.
The cold is set to return - temperatures in Fairbanks are forecast to drop to below -29C (-20F) this weekend. 
But warm, soggy episodes are likely to be more common in the future, Mr Thoman predicted.
""2021 really seems to be the year these extreme precipitation events have really come to the fore,"" he told the BBC.

51,Climate change,BBC News,Insulate Britain protests cost police more than Â£4m,2021-12-29,"Policing Insulate Britain's road-blocking protests over three months cost more than Â£4m, new figures have revealed.
The Met Police spent Â£4m on protests between 13 September and 20 November, according to figures released to the PA news agency under a Freedom of Information request.
Four other forces spent more than Â£300,000 combined.
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was ""appalled"" by the costs.
Insulate Britain wants the Government to insulate all UK homes by 2030 to cut carbon emissions.
It repeatedly blocked major roads between September and November, causing massive traffic disruption.
Activists also often glued their hands to the road or each other to make it harder to remove them.
The Met said 6,651 of the force's officers and staff were involved, at a cost of Â£3.1 million.
A further Â£600,000 was spent on deploying vehicles, while the overtime cost was Â£300,000, the force said.
Hertfordshire Police spent Â£185,000, Surrey Police Â£110,000, City of London Police Â£44,000 and Greater Manchester Police said it had spent Â£10,000 policing protests.
The total cost was likely to be much higher as these four forces only included overtime bills. 
For three months Insulate Britain frequently targeted the M25, the UK's busiest motorway, but also blocked roads in Manchester, Birmingham, London and the Port of Dover in Kent.
Mr Shapps said: ""I am appalled at the amount of time and public money that's been spent policing the selfish actions of Insulate Britain.
""Not only did their guerrilla tactics wreak havoc on our roads and inflict misery to thousands of motorists, but they diverted our emergency services away from vital work, costing the UK taxpayer millions in the process.""
Ken Marsh, chairman of the Met Police Federation which represents officers, described responding to the demonstrations on motorways as ""some of the most dangerous things my colleagues have had to do"".
National Highways applied for High Court injunctions to ban protests on motorways and major A roads in England after protestors repeatedly blocked junctions on the M25, some returning after being arrested and released from custody.
Ten Insulate Britain supporters have been jailed for breaching the injunctions so far, with prison sentences ranging from two to six months.
Mr Shapps is working to include new clauses in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill that creates tougher penalties for interfering with key infrastructure such as major roads. 
Insulate Britain spokeswoman Tracey Mallaghan said the group would ""much rather money was being spent on insulating homes and helping get people out of fuel poverty"".
She said they resorted to blocking roads after failing to get attention when they acted legally. 
""It seems the only way we can get air time is by annoying enough ordinary people,"" she said.
""Our government has proved time and time again they're not doing what is necessary for our children, for the future. So how can we stop?""

52,COP26,Matt McGrath,Climate change: Storm clouds gather after COP26,2021-12-29,"Is the progress that was made at the COP26 Glasgow climate summit already in jeopardy because of challenges in the year ahead?
2021 was a momentous year for climate change. 
As well as a host of extreme, destructive events influenced by rising temperatures, the past 12 months have seen unprecedented political engagement on the issue, culminating in the COP26 summit in Glasgow in November.
Progress was undoubtedly made and the overall thrust of the meeting was towards more rapid action on a whole host of measures to curb emissions.
But there are now growing concerns that this momentum may dissipate over the coming months. 
The most grievous blow comes from the US.
The potential failure of President Biden to get his Build Back Better act through Congress would significantly impact the ability of the US to meet the tough climate targets that the White House has committed to.  
It would also hugely affect the relatively unified approach to climate change on display among world leaders at COP26.
""Everything that Biden pledged, led to this relatively good atmosphere and a sense of momentum in Glasgow,"" said Dr Joanna Depledge, a fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Environment, Energy and Natural Resource Governance. 
""But these were just promises, he needs to get the bill through Congress. And it's now looking increasingly dicey. He can do some things with executive orders, but that certainly isn't the kind of sustained institutional climate legislation change that we're really looking for."" 
""I think the situation to us, is critical.""
The despair among many in the US over the possible failure of President Biden's bill will also have knock-on effects throughout the world. This will certainly be the case in China, a country smarting from the perception that it flexed its political muscle in Glasgow to get its way. Biden's political difficulties with the bill are seen as more evidence that the ""West is declining"".
""I am worried 2022 will see a fuller display of geopolitical tension dominating the climate agenda,"" said Li Shuo, from Greenpeace East Asia. 
He is also concerned that the mooted introduction of carbon taxes on imported goods into Europe could elevate a sense of unfairness and frustration in Beijing.
""The Chinese side will see how they are treated vis-a-vis others and make its judgment on whether the game is fair, and most importantly, if it is about the environment at all, or just geopolitics and trade,"" he told BBC News. Overall, I am looking at a more turbulent year ahead. The years before the Paris agreement were an example of geopolitics helping the climate agenda forward. What lies ahead may be the opposite.""
This pessimistic outlook is echoed by the fact that next year's COP is being held in Egypt, and the one after that in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). 
""Neither of these countries could be described as climate leaders,"" said Prof J Timmons Roberts from Brown University in Rhode Island, US. The good side is that COP27 will be in a developing country, and some issues like loss and damage [who pays for the impact of climate change in the worst affected countries, and how it is paid] may get more traction, but on the issue of emissions reductions, it's not clear that they're going to be leaders.""
Another key concern heading into 2022 is that some countries may simply ignore aspects of the Glasgow climate pact that they don't like. 
One key measure in the deal was the request for all countries to ""revisit and strengthen"" their national climate pledges by the time delegates gather in Egypt late in 2022. 
Despite agreeing to this, a number of countries now say they simply won't update their plans, among them Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand's climate minister James Shaw told national media that this provision really only applied to large emitters like India, China, Russia and Brazil which hadn't significantly strengthened their plans in time for Glasgow.
However, there are also some positive developments in the offing that could make a significant difference to the general mood around climate change.
During COP26, the UK, EU, US, Germany and France agreed to pay $8.5bn to help South Africa abandon coal. Now, those close to the negotiations say that two new deals to help India and Indonesia move away from the most carbon-intensive energy source are in the pipeline.
These will be expensive, running into the tens of billions, but if they happen, they would represent a massive step away from fossil fuels. These types of arrangements, and the commitment to doubling adaptation finance made by richer countries will be key to progress in 2022, say officials. 
Another positive is that the UK's presidency continues right up to next November when Egypt takes over. 
COP26 President Alok Sharma has made it clear that he intends to push forward over the coming months in efforts to ensure that the agreements secured in Glasgow on deforestation, coal, finance and cars will start to be implemented. 
Mr Sharma's background as an auditor will come in handy in making sure there's no slippage over the integrity of the commitments made. 
""The UK, as hosts of COP26, spent the last two years working tirelessly with countries to build trust, which ultimately allowed us to deliver the Glasgow climate pact,"" he told BBC News. ""We will continue in the same vein through 2022 to make sure countries keep their promises, re-visit their emissions reductions targets, get finance flowing, and deliver on the many commitments made during the two weeks of the summit.""
Another positive is the fact that Germany will chair the G7 group of countries. The co-leader of the German Green party is now the country's foreign minister, so climate will remain high on the international diplomatic agenda. 
Infrastructure investment in the wake of the Covid pandemic, especially in middle income countries, also offers a great chance to lock in significant action to limit emissions. 
The final agreement on the rules for carbon markets, agreed in Glasgow, has coincided with a record rise in the price of carbon permits in Europe and the UK. 
While this has downsides, a sustained high carbon price could significantly speed up a transition to cleaner sources of energy.
But, as ever, global events could see all these potential positives quickly pale. 
Disputes between Russia and Ukraine, China's disengagement and a drubbing for the Democrats in mid-term elections in the US could all derail or at least delay any further progress on climate change. 
And stalling or taking small steps right now would be a disaster for efforts to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century.
""Right now, incremental steps are a death sentence,"" said Prof Roberts. 
However, the climate negotiations process is highly unpredictable - and even when things appear to be at their darkest, countries are often able to make sufficient compromises to keep things moving forward. 
Certainly the COP26 president says he's determined to push ahead and that the UK can be a role model for others.
""Leaving COP26 with the Glasgow climate pact was a historic moment demonstrating the world's shared commitment to taking real climate action,"" said Alok Sharma.
""As we look ahead, the most pressing issue is the timescale on when this action takes place and the reality is that the world needs to act at a much faster pace.""
""I believe we will reach a net zero world, and the UK is leading the way through our own actions such as rapidly expanding our renewables sector and working to eliminate the use of coal from our electricity generation in 2024, the question is whether that will be fast enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change.""

53,Climate change,BBC News,More young drivers choosing to learn on automatic cars,2021-12-28,"The number of young drivers choosing to take their tests in automatic cars has tripled since 2008 according to the DVSA.
Only 3.8% of tests were taken in an automatic back then, but now it's closer to 14%. 
President of the AA Edmund King says it's because young people want to drive electric cars, which are automatic.
They say they'll be introducing electric car driving lessons in 2022.
Lessons will focus on how to conserve battery and drive with one pedal, instead of learning clutch control and how to change gears. 
AA and the BSM driving schools successfully trialled electric car lessons last year and will now both give instructors the option of leasing an electric car. 
It could also mean changes to driving tests in the near future as a way of keeping up to date with changing car technology.
DVSA's Deputy Chief driving examiner Gordon Witherspoon told Auto Express magazine earlier this year ""we constantly review tests for all vehicle types"" and ""take account of changes in driving habits"". 
He said the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency had already started to look at how to include electric cars in learner assessments. 
Petrol and diesel cars won't be allowed to be sold in the UK after 2030, meaning electric car sales will increase.
The biggest barrier for young people is still the price of buying and insuring an electric car - the cheapest in the UK being just over Â£17,000 new. 
Tom Webster is a motoring journalist. He says although electric cars can save you money in the long run, they aren't affordable on a budget yet. 
Because they're relatively new, there isn't a big market for second-hand electric cars.
""The traditional small car that first time buyers are looking at, only a couple of them have recently started going electric"", he tells Newsbeat.
""They are expensive to buy brand new, and it's going to take time for them to come down in price to the extent that young drivers will be able to afford them.""
Once they have eventually gone through he ""depreciation process"", it might be more achievable for more young drivers to get hold of electric cars at an affordable price.
But, Tom says, the change over to electric cars is a very gradual process. 
He says petrol and diesel cars are not ""going away overnight"", and in the meantime it could be a little more challenging to use one, because charging points are more inaccessible than petrol stations.
""A lot of young people live in towns and cities, a lot of towns and cities don't have off street parking, so it's very hard to get your own charging point at home that you'll always be able to rely on.""
If you don't have a home charging point, Tom says finding a public charging point which works and is free can be ""challenging"".
A government grant of Â£1,500 is available if you want to buy a new electric car under Â£32,000. 
Edmund King  told The Telegraph that ""there is still a reluctance"" for young people to make that commitment for those reasons, but hopes that will change in the near future.

54,Climate change,Sarbas Nazari,Crocodiles turn on humans amid Iran water crisis,2021-12-28,"Lying on the floor of his modest home, Siahouk was in excruciating pain from the injury to his right hand, the result of a nightmarish encounter. Just two days earlier, on a scorchingly hot August afternoon, the frail 70-year-old shepherd had gone to fetch water from a pond when he was pounced on by a gando, the local name for a mugger crocodile in Iran's Baluchistan region.  
""I didn't see it coming,"" he remembers of the traumatic event two years ago, with the shock and disbelief still vivid in his eyes.  
Siahouk was only able to escape once he ""managed to squeeze the plastic [water] bottle in between its jaws"", he says, reliving the moment as he rubs his bony face with his wrinkled left hand.  
The blood loss left Siahouk unconscious for half an hour. He was only found after his flock of sheep returned unaccompanied to his tiny village of Dombak.
Siahouk's account echoes that of many other victims, mostly children. More often than not, emotive headlines about Baluchi kids suffering grisly wounds inundate Iranian media, yet quickly disappear. 
In 2016, a nine-year-old called Alireza was swallowed by one such crocodile. And in July 2019, Hawa, 10, lost her right arm in an attack. Collecting water for laundry, she was almost dragged in by the crocodile before she was saved by her companions in a tug of war.  
The attacks have come at a time when Iran has been suffering acute water shortages and, consequentially, fast-shrinking natural habitats have seen the gandos' food supplies dry up. The starving animals treat humans approaching their territory either as prey or a menace to their evaporating resources. 
Scattered across Iran and the Indian subcontinent, gandos are broad-snouted crocodiles, classed as ""vulnerable"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Iran has an estimated 400, comprising nearly 5% of the species. Iran's Department of Environment says it is doing its utmost to strike a balance between preserving the gandos and protecting local people. 
Despite all the thirst-driven tragedies in recent years, there is little sign of the pledge being put into effect. Traveling alongside River Bahu-Kalat, the gandos' main habitat in Iran, there are hardly any signposts warning about the danger. 
In the absence of a calibrated government strategy, volunteers have stepped in to try to save the species by quenching their thirst and satiating their hunger. 
In Bahu-Kalat, a village named after the river, up the dirt road from Dombak, I sit down with Malek-Dinar, who has been living with gandos for years.
""I have killed my garden to bank water for these creatures,"" he says of his land once thriving with bananas, lemons and mangoes. 
The river in the vicinity is home to a number of those crocodiles he regularly feeds with chicken breasts, because ""the killer heat has left frogs and their typical prey scarce"". 
""Come on, come here,"" Malek-Dinar repeatedly summons the crocodiles, while asking me to keep a safe distance. In the blink of an eye, two show up, waiting to be fed their ration of chicken from the familiar white bucket. 
Iran's water scarcity is not unique to Baluchistan. Deadly protests erupted in the oil-rich south-western Khuzestan province in July. And in late November, riot police in the central city of Isfahan fired birdshot at protesters gathered in the dried-up bed of the River Zayandeh-Roud. 
With global warming already showing its ugly face in Iran, the implications for Baluchistan could be catastrophic when coupled with decades of water mismanagement. 
After pulling over in Shir-Mohammad Bazar to shelter from a dust storm I meet women doing laundry in the open. 
""There is piping infrastructure but no running water,"" 35-year-old Malek-Naz tells me. Her husband, Osman, smirks at my question about showers, pointing to the sight of a woman bathing her son in a vessel of salty water next door. 
Osman, a father of five, and his cousin, Noushervan, who joins the conversation, make a living transporting petrol to neighbouring Pakistan, where it can be sold for more than at home. 
""There are numerous risks,"" Noushervan admits, albeit in a defiant tone. ""But let it be when there is no job."" And the risk has been real. In February, Iran's border guards opened fire on a group of ""fuel smugglers"", killing at least 10. 
Such crackdowns are commonplace in the sensitive border area, where successive Iranian administrations have worried about security. 
""They are wilfully turning a blind eye to our anguish. Trust me, we are no enemy of the state,"" Osman says, complaining of what he and many disillusioned Baluchis describe as ""systematic neglect"" of the community. 
Still, to him and a countless more Baluchis, unemployment is far less of a challenge than the water shortages that have turned even gandos - the ""blissful"" creatures with whom they once peacefully coexisted - against them. 
""We don't expect any government handout. We don't expect them to put jobs on a platter for us,"" says Noushervan. ""We Baluchis can survive on loaves of bread in a desert. But water is the essence of life. We won't survive without it, and who does?""

Gas and electricity bills have risen by about Â£400 a year on average and Ofgem, the UK's energy regulator, has warned costs will spike further next year.
Ministers in Wales plan to force house builders to cut the carbon footprint of new homes by more than a third in 2022.
But developers want more government help to meet new building standards.
Families are bracing themselves to pay more for their energy as industry experts predict those that were paying Â£850 on average last year will see their bills rise to more than Â£1700.
The energy price cap, which limits how much providers can charge for energy per unit, will rise in the spring because of the ""unprecedented"" rise in gas prices that has seen some energy companies go bust.
""In December 2020 the average energy bill was Â£850,"" said Stephen Murray, from price comparison website Moneysupermarket.
""By April next year, if you're on a standard tariff, it will be around Â£1750 - that's over double where it was.""
There are up to 25 million UK homes with gas boilers but they are being phased out - with none being sold after 2035 - as gas heating accounts for 21% of the UK's carbon emissions.
Moneysupermarket has warned families could face ""expected increases of Â£450 to Â£500 at a one-off stroke"" because of the crisis, caused by more demand and less supply.
There are plans to help subsidise low-carbon heat pumps in place of gas boilers in some homes in Wales and England from April 2022 but with the country in the midst of an energy crisis, should solar panels be a new standard on all new homes?
For a medium-sized house, one established installer estimates a good 4kW solar panel system from a well-respected brand would cost about Â£6,000 to Â£7,000 to install.
Gareth Jones says his company, Carbon Zero Renewables, experienced a 1000% surge in orders for solar roof panels since the start of the energy crisis, with weekly enquiries surging from ""one or two to 25 to 30"".
""The reasons people are considering solar panels has changed from wanting to make money, to doing it to help the climate crisis,"" said Mr Jones, who is based in St Asaph, Denbighshire.
""You're not going to make much putting electricity back into the grid, but the environmental aspect is now a big driver - coupled with not getting impacted by soaring energy costs.
""And with gas being phased out, turning your home into its own electric creation station is proving attractive to some people. Plus if you have an electric car to charge too, customers like the fact all the energy they use is clean.
""Good systems aren't cheap but with energy costs rising, people think they can make their money back quicker than before - and good panels have a long lifespan.""
But while having a panel on your roof might work for many households, Mr Jones is quick to stress that while families should consider seeing if the sun would be a viable and cost-effective option to power and heat your home, it won't work for everyone.
""If your house is very shaded or possibly doesn't get the sun as much as most, then perhaps it might not work for you,"" he said.
""People need to consider amending their lifestyles too, so using electricity when the solar panels are creating energy when it's sunny. So instead of putting the dishwasher or washing machine on when it's dark, you do it in the day.
""The other things that need to be checked is if your roof is strong enough to support the panels and whether the location is appropriate - that's why it's advised to get a good and respected installer.""
So with an energy crisis and an estimated average of 7,400 new homes needed in Wales every year to keep up with housing demand, are governments considering dictating to builders new clean energy standards?
The Welsh government, for example, has declared a climate emergency and set steep targets to become net zero by 2050, so Wales' climate change minister is planning to tell developers that any new homes built from 2022 must cut emissions by 37%, compared to current standards.
But Julie James plans to leave it to the individual house builder on individual developments to decide how their homes will reduce their footprint - like solar panels or heat pumps - as Ms James accepts not all renewable energy sources work everywhere.
""We don't mandate a particular technology, we're mandating a particular outcome,"" she told the BBC.
One-sixth of Wales' carbon emissions come from heating and powering homes, yet new homes are still being built without clean energy consideration.
Ministers in Cardiff see renewable power as a way of helping people pay their bills and reducing fuel poverty - as well as moving towards net zero by 2050.
""This is a win-win situation for everyone really,"" said Ms James, the only minister in the UK whose brief is just climate change.
""This isn't just because I tend to like this kind of house, this is a climate emergency we are seeing... we see the extreme weather conditions people will have to cope with inside their houses. 
""We want the house to be able to withstand those increased weather pressures.""
The Welsh government is working with the construction industry to cut the carbon footprint on homes by at least 37% from next year - and to make sure as many of the supplies come from Wales to reduce any supply chain carbon footprint.
How will that extra cost affect you?
The organisation that represents small developers agrees climate change is the biggest threat, and that renewable energy built into new homes is the future.

But the Federation of Master Builders (FMB) has warned the cost could be picked up by customers, which could affect first-time buyers the most.
""There are 70,000 households in Wales on housing waiting lists and we need more homes built,"" said Ifan Glyn, FMB Wales director.
""To enable that, small builders need extra support from Welsh government to help them meet any new housing standards.""
Some housing associations have already started fitting solar panels to new and existing homes after securing grants from the Welsh government - and they could provide a template for how to install panels to new homes cost-effectively that could be upscaled for major housing developments.
""Now when architects look at a brand new site, we think 'how easy is it to walk to?'"" said Elfed Roberts, of Pobl Housing's latest development at Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taf.
""Then we analyse where the sun is, where the great views are and where does the wind come from, that is a new way of working in new-home construction.""

57,COP26,Matt McGrath,Climate change: Huge toll of extreme weather disasters in 2021,2021-12-27,"Weather events, linked to a changing climate, brought misery to millions around the world in 2021 according to a new report. 
The study, from the charity Christian Aid, identified 10 extreme events that each caused more than $1.5bn of damage. 
The biggest financial impacts were from Hurricane Ida which hit the US in August and flooding in Europe in July. 
In many poorer regions, floods and storms caused mass displacements of people and severe suffering.
Not every extreme weather event is caused by or linked to climate change, although scientists have become bolder in exploring the connections. 
One leading researcher, Dr Friederike Otto, tweeted earlier this year that every heatwave happening in the world now is ""made more likely and more intense"" by human induced climate change.
In relation to storms and hurricanes, there is growing evidence that climate change is also affecting these events. 
In August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published the first part of its sixth assessment report.
In relation to hurricanes and tropical cyclones, the authors said they had ""high confidence"" that the evidence of human influence has strengthened. 
""The proportion of intense tropical cyclones, average peak tropical cyclone wind speeds, and peak wind speeds of the most intense tropical cyclones will increase on the global scale with increasing global warming,"" the study said. 
Just a few weeks after that report came out, Hurricane Ida hit the US. 
According to Christian Aid it was the most financially destructive weather event of the year.
The slow-moving hurricane saw thousands of residents in Louisiana evacuated out of its path. 
That storm brought massive rainfall across a number of states and cities, with New York issuing a flash-flood emergency alert for the first time.
Around 95 people died, with the economic losses estimated at $65bn. 
The second most financial costly event was the widespread flooding across Germany, France and other European countries in July.
The speed and intensity of the water overwhelmed defences and 240 people lost their lives. Reported damages were around $43bn.
In the study, the majority of the weather events in the list occurred in developed countries. 
That's because it is more feasible to estimate financial losses from insurance claims and these are usually available in richer countries, where people can afford to insure their homes and businesses. 
According to insurance company Aon, 2021 is likely to be the fourth time in five years that global natural catastrophes have cost more than $100bn. 
The report also documents many other events where the financial impact is harder to ascertain, but where the impact on people is significant. 
Flooding in South Sudan displaced over 800,000 people while 200,000 had to move to escape Cyclone Tauktae which hit India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives in May. 
""That's a huge human impact,"" said report author Dr Kat Kramer from Christian Aid.
""Obviously, losing your home, your livelihoods, and everything, and not having the resources to rebuild that is incredibly tough. Whereas at least if you have insurance, you have some mechanism for building that back.""
The report highlights the need for increased efforts on curbing emissions of carbon dioxide to reduce future weather related impacts. It is also calling on global climate diplomats to put their money where their mouth is and help poorer countries that suffer huge economic losses.
In the COP26 global climate talks in Glasgow, this issue of finance for loss and damage caused by climate-related events saw major disagreement between countries. Developing nations wanted cash - the richer ones said we need more talks on the question.
 ""Although it was good to see the issue of loss and damage become a major issue at COP26, it was bitterly disappointing to leave without a fund set up to actually help people who are suffering permanent losses from climate change,' said Nushrat Chowdhury, Christian Aid's climate justice adviser in Bangladesh.
""Bringing that fund to life needs to be a global priority in 2022.""

58,Climate change,Justin Rowlatt,Wildlife's winners and losers of 2021 - and how extreme weather set the tone,2021-12-27,"Wildlife across the UK is increasingly suffering the impacts of extreme weather events and natural disasters, says the National Trust as it publishes its annual reckoning of UK wildlife ""winners and losers"".
The conservation charity also warns some of the landscapes it cares for are being altered forever as climate change makes some forms of extreme weather the new normal.
It points to the very dry spring that saw wildfires devastate parts of National Trust estates in the Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland and Marsden Moor in Yorkshire.  
The fires destroyed habitats for a range of threatened species including golden plover and Irish hare.
Meanwhile our warmer, wetter winters have accelerated the spread of diseases such as ash dieback, causing significant loss of trees, the charity says.  
This year's settled and warm autumn led to a spectacular show of colour but that was brought to an abrupt end when Storm Arwen ripped through the north of the country in November causing widespread destruction.
It uprooted thousands of trees on National Trust land in the Lake District and destroyed hundreds of irreplaceable trees and plants at its Bodnant Garden in Wales.
At Wallington in Northumberland, where gusts reached 98mph, more than half of the 250-year-old oak and beech trees were uprooted.   
""These extreme events are putting even more pressure on Britain's wildlife"", warns Ben McCarthy, head of nature conservation at the trust.  
He says more than half of UK species are already in decline and 15% of wildlife species are under threat of extinction.
""Isolated or small populations are the most at risk from climate impacts,"" he says, but not all species have suffered. Some animals and plants have actually flourished this year.
Here's a selection of the National Trust's run down of winners and losers on the 250,000 hectares of countryside, 780 miles of coastline and 500 historic properties, gardens and nature reserves it looks after:
The grey seal colonies cared for by the National Trust are expecting another increase in pup numbers thanks to a lack of predators and plentiful food. 
Orford Ness on the Suffolk coast recorded record numbers of seals. Normally one or two are seen at a time, but this year 200 were out on the beach together and stayed for several days.  
The dry May and exceptionally warm June helped unroll carpets of pyramidal orchids across Rodborough Common in Gloucestershire.  
Autumn lady's-tresses, the latest flowering UK orchid species, also had a very good year thanks to the cold wet May.  The plant's distinctive spires of white flowers appeared in the thousands at some grasslands and sand dunes in southern England and Wales. 
There was good news for the beavers released on the Holnicote Estate on Exmoor in January last year. Their first kit was born in June. 
It has also been a bumper year for grassland fungi with waxcaps doing especially well - evidence that some grasslands are thriving. In Shropshire, National Trust rangers were delighted to find 17 species of these fungi in one meadow. 
Meanwhile in Herefordshire, the team discovered an example striking non-native species - called Devil's Fingers or Octopus Stinkhorn - which was introduced to Europe accidentally from Australia or New Zealand around 1920.  
Butterflies have had a particularly bad year with the lowest numbers of the insects recorded in the Butterfly Conservation's Big Butterfly Count.  
National Trust teams reported butterflies emerging later due to the very cool spring, although the range of species remained stable. 
Oak trees in the south of England hardly produced any acorns this year, says the trust, in contrast to oaks further north which had a bumper crop. 
Oak flowers need dry warm weather to successfully produce acorns - conditions found in the north of England but not down south.  
The record number of late frosts through April - and into late May - in some parts of the country hammered apple blossom and led to a poor apple harvest, particularly in northern parts of England and Northern Ireland.  
It was a topsy-turvy year for terns too. 
At Blakeney Point in Norfolk, little terns - one species of these small seabirds - abandoned their nests, scared off by the presence of a short-eared owl and common gulls. But the neighbouring colonies of sandwich and common terns did well, the Trust says.

59,Climate change,BBC News,"Floods getting bigger and more frequent, says river expert",2021-12-26,"Floods on the River Severn and other waterways in the West Midlands are likely to continue getting bigger and more frequent, an expert has said.
Dave Throup retires this month after 21 years with the Environment Agency.
He said climate change was going to continue to have a significant impact on people living and working near the Severn, the UK's longest river.
Ahead of retirement, he reflected on his ""great"" job and becoming a familiar face in the media at times of flooding. 
Mr Throup, 56, began working for the agency on 1 January 2000 but said the floods of 2007 were his ""first taste of flooding on an almost apocalyptic scale"".
""We started seeing rivers do things we had never seen them do before and the penny really started to drop,"" he said.
""I remember being scared at the time, thinking 'This is not what normally happens'... there were people in the incident room saying 'This can't be right, it just doesn't happen' and some of these people had 30 or 40 years' experience seeing what rivers do.
""Since then, there have been five or six really big flood events and I've travelled all over [the] country, working in flood response in the Lake District, on the east coast and down south as well, and they all see a bit of it."" 
The largest floods ever recorded on the River Wye, which runs through Herefordshire, happened in 2020, he said.
Ahead of leaving his role, he said climate change would continue to have a huge impact on the size and scale of flooding in the West Midlands region. 
""We have had multiple big floods... and they are getting bigger and more frequent,"" Mr Throup said.
""I think the future is very uncertain but we also see very significant impacts from climate-related incidents.
""Flooding is one thing, as floods get bigger and more frequent, but that is only one part of story. I believe we are going to see significant water shortages as well in parts of our geography, 60 to 70% drops, which will not leave enough water for businesses and wildlife.
""These are really significant issues facing society and the speed with which they are happening [is] so scary, the stuff that has happened just in my lifetime has been incredible.""
As area manager for Herefordshire and Worcestershire, at times of flooding he is often called to manage incidents, working in the control room for weeks.
In the incident room, he said, people would work eight-hour shifts for five to six days, then have a rest day before continuing. 
""With the flooding you tend to get in this part of world, they are quite long lived. So if it is a big flood, you're working 24/7 for three or four weeks... it is full on,"" Mr Throup said. 
""It is quite a pressurised atmosphere in that room, when things happen you have got to react quick.
""Working with other professional partners like police and fire and rescue, it is a good vibe you get going and we do work together very well.""
When not working as an incident commander he is a media contact and said, during floods in 2014, he had once done 60 interviews in one day.
""The media world just descends with satellite trucks,"" he said.
""I spoke to everyone from Kerrang to Al Jazeera and some German TV company who couldn't understand a word I am saying, it was absolutely full on.""
The role also involves speaking with those affected by flooding, he said, which could be one of the hardest parts of the job. 
""You are taking some of the anger and the heat from it, but that is part of the role,"" he said.
""You are there in an Environment Agency jacket and people are flooded, they are understandably angry and upset, that is a difficult part of job, but it goes with the territory.""
He is also well known for his social media presence, at one time sparking his own fan club.
A self-confessed early-adopter of social media, he said he had found it a ""very powerful way to be able communicate with people with immediacy"".
""I've had fantastic messages since I announced my retirement,"" Mr Throup said, with more than 200 messages of people wishing him well and more than 1,000 likes. 
Mr Throup previously worked for Rentokil, as a planning officer in south Wales and for Severn Trent Water before moving to the Environment Agency.
Born and bred in Worcestershire, it has been ""nice to make a bit of a difference in the patch"", he said.
Married to Cathryn, with two grown-up children, Mr Throup said he hoped to spend the early part of his retirement travelling, if Covid-19 restrictions allowed.
""My wife is a teacher so we have never been able to travel much,"" he said.

61,Climate change,BBC News,Welsh cook will spend Christmas aboard Boaty McBoatface,2021-12-24,"A Welsh chef will enjoy the ultimate white Christmas - on Boaty McBoatface's maiden voyage to Antarctica.
Steve Carpenter, 49, from Caerphilly, is a cook steward on the exploration ship, officially named RRS Sir David Attenborough.
He will serve Christmas dinner in the winter wonderland setting, but penguins, seals and polar bears are staying off the menu.
Steve said it would be ""traditional"" and served on Christmas Eve.
The Â£200m ship, part of the UK government's polar infrastructure investment programme, is due to return in May or June.
An online poll had suggested the ship be named Boaty McBoatface - but one of its robotic submarines has been given this moniker instead.
Making sure everyone gets a proper Christmas dinner is a big priority for the galley crew, as they celebrate the festive period on the other side of the world.
Being 8,500 miles from home has meant most of the dinner has been prepared in advance.
""We've got 10kg of Christmas pud for the crew to consume, 5kg of Christmas cake baked by our baker on board and iced and decorated and through the Christmas period we'll go through 500 mince pies,"" said Steve.
He added that because of the lack of availability of fresh fruit and vegetables on the voyage, they will use frozen sprouts - cooking about 300 for the meal, along with 20kg of roast potatoes and 34kg of stuffing for the 49 people on board.
""It's another working day for us in the galley, but hopefully we'll be able to sit down at the end of the meal and enjoy it with everyone,"" he said.
The RRS Sir David Attenborough is travelling from Rothera research station on Adelaide Island to Signey Island, where they are due to arrive on Christmas Day and where more scientists will disembark.
Working at sea for the past 25 years, Steve's had his fair share of far-flung Decembers, several times enjoying a curry Christmas dinner in the Middle East, during his time in the Royal Auxiliary Fleet.
But this year, he will have a guaranteed white Christmas in a place he says, ""doesn't compare to anywhere else"".
""This is my first trip down south. It's such an amazing opportunity to get down here. It's an absolutely mind-blowing place.""
Minister for the polar regions, Amanda Milling, said: ""This magnificent ship is something everyone across the United Kingdom can take immense pride in. I'd like to wish everyone on board for its maiden voyage a Merry Christmas.""

63,Climate change,Marco Silva,Climate change: Small army of volunteers keeping deniers off Wikipedia,2021-12-24,"Wikipedia has for so long been plagued by climate change denial. But a group of dedicated volunteers around the world is working tirelessly to keep the deniers at bay.
David Tetta lives in northern California, in the kind of close-knit community where neighbours just wander into each other's homes - during our interview, he breaks off for a second to shoo one of them out of the room.
It was while chatting to his neighbours that David first thought of volunteering to edit Wikipedia. In 2019, around the time wildfires were raging across the state, climate change was coming up more and more often as a topic. 
""Many conversations seemed to evolve into people expressing their feelings of angst and fear about the environment,"" he says. 
""I was wondering, what kind of information are people getting?""
David was well-placed to study the subject, having worked for the US Environmental Protection Agency for more than 30 years. 
He looked at the most obvious starting point for climate change information, Wikipedia - and, as he diplomatically puts it, he found ""certain areas of it that could be improved"".
He started small by proposing edits and discussing them with other volunteers. But he soon found himself pouring hundreds of hours into Wikipedia editing. 
""You have to read through about 100 pages of scientific information to edit a sentence,"" he says. 
English Wikipedia alone gets more than nine billion page views a month, and the magnitude of that figure is not lost on David.
""It gives you a certain sense of responsibility for making sure you're getting it right.""
The point of Wikipedia is that anyone with an internet connection can edit it. But that also makes it vulnerable to manipulation, and those who deny the climate crisis know it.
They've been waging an editing war to get their views across, and subtlety is not always their forte.
On one occasion, someone added a sentence wrongly suggesting climate scientists worldwide are in the pocket of a secretive Communist organisation.
Another user peppered paragraphs with the word ""alleged"", wrongly suggesting that basic climate science is far less settled than you might think.
And, in a rather mischievous twist, one time the entire text of an article on climate change was turned into a hyperlink. Users clicking on any of it would immediately be taken to an article about hoaxes.
Those kinds of stunts don't last long, though.
""That might stay up for a few minutes or an hour or so,"" David says. ""But usually, one of the editors will spot it.""
David is part of a small but dedicated group of volunteers who have made it their mission to curate and protect articles about climate change on English Wikipedia. And they're not afraid to pick a fight.
""I'll send [the deniers] a note on their personal page on Wikipedia saying, 'This is vandalism, this could have consequences,'"" says David. ""Sometimes these people get kicked off Wikipedia.""
Wikipedia, which was launched in 2001, has grown into one of the world's most popular websites, and is published in more than 300 different languages.
English Wikipedia is the largest version - and, according to the editors interviewed for this piece, the one where you can find the most reliable coverage of climate change.
""We are lucky with a large editor base,"" says Dutch volunteer Femke Nijsse. 
She's come to be regarded as one of the most influential voices within the small community of Wikipedia editors specialising in climate change.
If you have ever visited the main Wikipedia article on climate change, chances are that you read some of Femke's words - she's the user who's contributed the most to that article by far.
""I'm quite proud of my work on Wikipedia,"" she says.
Femke is a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Exeter, studying the transition to green energy - so global warming is something she's been thinking about for a while.
She's been editing Wikipedia articles for seven years and in that time she's got to know what junk science looks like.
""Editors recognise all of the common climate denial myths, and most editors have a good feeling for misinformation red flags, including use of unreliable sources, of emotive words,"" she says.
""The most satisfying editing for me is the removal of misinformation."" 
Femke is clinical in her debunking of bad science, and a stickler for Wikipedia's rules.
In October, a user tried to add a sentence to the climate change article, wrongly suggesting that stopping the world from using fossil fuels would make no difference to global warming. Femke dismissed the edit, but not before explaining that such a statement would have to be backed by reliable sources.
Wikipedia doesn't have a policy vetoing climate change denial, but there are policies that insist you have to cite quality sources, which tends to weed unscientific content out. 
""Wikipedia is just an uncomfortable place to be if you want to promote a point of view that goes against science,"" says volunteer editor Su-Laine Brodsky, a technology writer by profession. ""It's much easier to be on social media, where you can say whatever you want, and not really be held to task for it.""
From her home in Canada, Su-Laine has been editing Wikipedia pages for 15 years. 
She started out by sharing medical information and moved on to writing about sea otters and killer whales. She only recently decided to focus on climate pages.
""I've always been interested in the environment and wildlife, and was kind of intimidated by the idea of working on climate change,"" she says. ""I thought of climate change as a very technical and very controversial topic.""
But one day she stumbled across an article on sustainable energy that was riddled with problems. ""It had a lot of self-promotion - companies promoting themselves, people who are doing some kind of research promoting their pet project.""
Su-Laine got stuck in and started getting rid of it. 
""Wikipedians are people who fix things,"" she says. ""You notice something that's wrong, and you just need to have enough confidence to say, 'I can make this suck a bit less.'""
Sometimes the errors are obvious. But it didn't take long for Su-Laine to realise some users were twisting the facts in subtler ways, especially in less-trafficked articles. 
""When you've got an article about a climate science denier, people will try to soften that by saying so-and-so is a 'climate policy analyst'. That's a way of making the person sound more credible,"" she says. 
According to Alex Stinson from the Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, climate misinformation ranges from neglect - science that's out of date - to a lack of balance, to active disinformation. 
He's confident the organisation has what it takes to deal with the problem. 
""All of the studies on vandalism and misinformation suggest that our natural immune system on the big language Wikipedias catches something like 97% of it rapidly,"" he says. 
As well as human editors, the organisation also uses computer bots to fight vandalism. High-profile articles, including some about climate, also benefit from additional layers of protection - some of them can only be edited by users with a certain amount of editing experience. 
But there will always be areas of the website that are harder to patrol. 
""There are over 6,300,000 articles on English Wikipedia,"" Alex says. ""Not all of those are under the same kind of universal scrutiny of the community.""
And bad information, even outright conspiracies theories, are more common on climate pages in languages other than English, according to a recent BBC investigation. 
For now, it is entirely down to volunteers to hold the fort.

64,Climate change,Louise Cullen,Poots launches consultation on Future Agricultural Policy,2021-12-21,"The agriculture minister has launched a consultation on policy proposals for the Future Agriculture Policy.  
It is based on four outcomes - productivity, environmental sustainability, improved resilience and an effectively functioning supply chain.  
The aim is to try to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from farming. 
Agriculture as a sector is the largest emitter in Northern Ireland.  
Among the proposals are a reduction in the age at which cattle would go to slaughter, a ""farming for nature"" package and a ""farming for carbon"" package. 
""Farming for Nature"" is expected to form a central plank of agricultural support, over time.  
Its main focus will be on improving biodiversity on farms, through measures like hedgerows, integration of trees within crops and livestock farming, and protected areas.  
The ""Farming for Carbon"" strand aims to reduce the carbon footprint of the agricultural industry through a number of proposals, including reducing the number of older cattle for slaughter, improved genetics, and feed additives.  
The agriculture minister said designing the policy was ""a unique opportunity"" to redefine agricultural policy.
Edwin Poots also said it was a chance to ""target support to meet local priorities and needs much more effectively"".
""As we build out this future portfolio, I want to ensure that farmers are supported and equipped with the right tools to continue producing high quality, nutritious food whilst importantly, also reducing their environmental impact,"" he added.
The consultation is open until 15 February 2022, with early findings to be published early in the year.

66,Climate change,Jesse Preyser,Miners experiment with hydrogen to power giant trucks,2021-12-21,"Mining trucks are monstrous machines that guzzle fuel at a scarcely believable rate.
Weighing 220 tonnes, they can get through 134 litres of diesel every hour. 
Little wonder then that mining companies are focusing their attention on these vehicles as the first step to reducing their carbon footprint.
Anglo American, in collaboration with several partners, is retrofitting a mining haul truck with hydrogen power technology.
A first of its kind, the monster mining vehicle is being piloted in Limpopo, South Africa, at the firm's Mogalakwena platinum mine. 
Due to be launched in early 2022, the truck will be hybrid, with a hydrogen fuel cell providing roughly half of the power and a battery pack the other half. 
Instead of having a tank of diesel that powers the motor, hydrogen enters the fuel cell and mixes with oxygen to create water in a chemical reaction catalysed by platinum, which generates the electricity needed to power the motors that drive the wheels.
It only emits water vapour and the company says it has the potential to reduce on-site diesel emissions by up to 80%.
By rolling out this technology across its global truck fleet, Anglo American says it will be ""taking the equivalent of half a million diesel cars off the road"". 
The trucks also harvest regenerative energy created when driving downhill and braking, which is stored in the battery and extends the range of the vehicle.
Anglo is developing the truck along with partners Engie, NPROXX, First Mode, Williams Advanced Engineering, Ballard, ABB, Nel and Plug Power.
However, reducing the carbon footprint of the mining industry is a formidable task.
The construction sector, which includes mining, accounted for 36% of global final energy use and 39% of energy-related CO2 emissions in 2017, according to Davide Sabbadin, senior policy officer for climate and circular economy at the European Environmental Bureau (EEB).
He says the sector will need to reduce its energy consumption by a third if it hopes to be compatible with the Paris Agreement.
Hydrogen-powered trucks are a good start but need closer inspection, says Diego Marin, associate policy officer for environmental justice at the EEB. 
""While electric-powered vehicles, generally speaking, are less damaging to the environment than internal combustion engines on a life cycle analysis, this does not mean that they are green,"" he says.
Mr Marin points out it all hinges on how the hydrogen is produced. Some hydrogen is created using fossil fuels, which of course means there are substantial emissions as a result.
Anglo American says it is pulling out all the stops in an attempt to attain carbon neutrality by 2040.
Its hydrogen-powered hauler uses green hydrogen, which is made by splitting water atoms into oxygen and hydrogen, through electrolysis.
Even that is treated with caution by the EEB. 
""We should refrain from presenting hydrogen as a technological solution to all problemsâ¦ all forms of hydrogen come at an environmental cost - water use, impacts on nature,"" says Mr Sabbadin. 
The EEB also points out that hydrogen power has a shorter storage life than other renewables and is substantially more expensive to produce.  
More technology of business:
Whether it be investment for the mining industry's green goals or hydrogen power as a broader power solution, the issue of cost is definitely a pertinent one in South Africa. 
Jarrad Wright, an energy consultant and principal engineer for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) explains. 
""Hydrogen for power production is still quite expensive and unlikely to compete for some time."" 
This is largely due to a lack of supporting infrastructure for the new forms of energy to be created, distributed or stored. 
But, Mr Wright adds that it is possible to migrate to hydrogen in specific applications. 
At the moment South Africa's hydrogen power infrastructure is still sparse.
But the government and private partners are exploring ways to transform the country's platinum belt into a ""hydrogen valley"", with a focus on producing green hydrogen.
Anglo American is one of the private partners in this hydrogen infrastructure plan, which aims to create a regional renewable energy ecosystem. 
The starting point for this ecosystem is due to be built at the Mogalakwena mine itself, through the construction of a hydrogen production and storage complex. It incorporates the largest electrolyser in Africa, a solar power field, and will generate approximately 140MW of green power. 
Initially, it will be to support the 24-hour operation of the new truck, but once operational, the aim is for numerous complexes such as this one, to serve as local and regional hubs for the emerging hydrogen economy.
""The ecosystem would not only help us reduce our... emissions, but would also provide the foundation for green hydrogen production, facilitating the roll-out of hydrogen-powered haul trucks across South Africa,"" Anglo says.

67,Budget 2021,BBC News,Welsh budget: Bumper funding rise for Welsh NHS amid backlog,2021-12-20,"NHS spending in Wales will jump next year to tackle record high waiting times created by Covid.
An extra Â£893m will be pumped in during 2022, as part of the Â£24.6bn Welsh government budget.
More cash has also been promised for councils, and Labour Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said the budget will help make Wales ""a fairer nation"".
Welsh Conservatives said the budget had been made possible after record funding from the UK government.
Shops and hospitality will get a 50% cut to business rates - a relief to some firms waiting to hear if there would be any help for the tax from April.
Plaid Cymru said the spending plans will deliver a ""stronger"" Wales, following the party's co-operation agreement with Welsh Labour ministers.
The Welsh government say that over three years it will provide Â£1.3bn in extra direct funding to the Welsh NHS.
Most of that - Â£893m - will arrive in the first financial year. That is a 10.7% increase on the current budget, or 7.8% when inflation is taken into account, with smaller increases in later years.
Numbers waiting for treatments hit record levels last August.
Budget documents say the government's ""highest priority is to address the backlog of treatments that have been delayed by the pandemic"".
Helen Whyley of the Royal College of Nurses said a significant portion has to be spent on NHS salaries, with 1,719 vacancies in Wales.
The union is currently in dispute with the Welsh government over pay.
""You can have all the money in the world for services,"" Ms Whyley said. ""But if you don't have the staff to care for patients, and to deliver that care safely, it won't buy you anything.""
Despite the rise in day-to-day spending, funding for health care facilities will fall from Â£377m to Â£279m next year.
The Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents health organisations, said its ""members are disappointed in the lack of investment in capital infrastructure to improve and redesign NHS estates and facilities"".
Cardiff University's Guto Ifan said the planned increase for NHS spending in Wales appears to be ""slightly below"" extra cash for Wales triggered because of NHS spending in England.
""There are huge uncertainties about the medium-term impact of the pandemic and these spending plans could well need to be revised upwards in later years.""
Council funding will increase by Â£384m to Â£5.1bn - 8.1% in nominal terms or 5.2% when inflation is taken into account.
Officials say this is the largest increase to the cash for local government - which is spent on social care and other services - since devolution began.
Mr Ifan said councils should be able to meet their spending needs next year ""with relatively low increases in council tax"".
The announcement follows a promise of more cash for Welsh public services from the Treasury, which provides the lion's share of the Welsh government's money.
Experts at Cardiff University say Â£2.9bn will be available to spend by 2024.
It also comes after an agreement between the Welsh government and Plaid Cymru which included free school meals over three years and expanding free childcare to two-year-olds.
Both were included in the budget, with Â£30m for early years and childcare, and Â£90m for free school meals over three years.
According to the Welsh government, businesses in retail, leisure and hospitality will receive 50% rates relief for 2022-23, matching similar plans announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak for England.
It will be less than the 100% discount many such firms receive now. The scheme will be capped at Â£110,000 per business.
With other relief schemes ministers say 85,000 properties will be supported, while a further Â£35m will be spent to freeze rates for 2022-23.
Despite the announcement, Michael Manghan and Rhian Davies, who run the Crown and Sceptre in Cadoxton, Neath, are still concerned for what 2022 will hold.
Ms Davies feared the rate bill they would now need to pay was a ""big chunk of money to find"".
She said she would have like to have seen more, but added: ""It's better than nothing.""
Mr Manghan said: ""The money we've lost over the last year - we're only just coming back to repay people.""
Sam Dabb, who runs Le Pub in Newport, was pleased to hear the news. ""It's one of the main costs of the business, it's absolutely massive.""
One businessman said the Welsh government definitely had to meet the 50% cut introduced in England, and warned next year could be tough.
The Vale Resort in Hensol, Vale of Glamorgan, is starting to recover after a difficult 21 months. 
Bookings have increased since Covid restrictions were lifted and the company has opened a distillery on site to expand the business. 
Its managing director, Stephen Leeke, said government support schemes such as furlough, business rate relief and the Economic Resilience Fund (ERF) had helped the company stay afloat. 
He said: ""There's certainly an argument to say that they might consider going further, because I think we are in for a bit of a roller coaster now in the next couple of months and I don't think there's any doubt the industry will need some support.""
The Welsh government said it would spend Â£1.8bn on investments in its climate change department over three years, which includes Â£1.6bn on housing.
Of that, Â£1bn will be spent on housing and Â£375m for building safety.
Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said the Welsh government was still operating in a ""difficult financial context with our budget nearly Â£3bn lower than if it had increased in line with the economy since 2010-11"".
""This budget will support the Wales of today and shape the Wales of tomorrow. It will support our public services to be stronger, put Wales further down the path to being a net zero nation, and create a fairer nation with equality at its heart,"" she said.
Welsh Conservative finance spokesman Peter Fox said: ""Today's budget has been made possible by the Conservative government delivering record funding for Wales.
""In that light, I welcome the much-needed business rates holiday to help firms recover from the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, along with an important uplift in funding for our local authorities who deliver so many key services in communities across Wales.""
Llyr Gruffydd, Plaid Cymru finance spokesperson, said: ""Thanks to Plaid Cymru, this budget will deliver an even fairer, even greener, even stronger Wales through ambitious policy pledges.
""From free school meals for all primary pupils to extending free childcare to all two-year olds and much more, the commitments secured by Plaid Cymru as part of the co-operation agreement with Welsh government will secure transformational support for some of our poorest households and will change people's lives for the better across Wales.""
There will be relief among the many thousands working in hospitality, retail and leisure across Wales.
The Welsh government has matched what is happening in England and business rates for those industries will be halved. Most of them will still struggle to pay that as the pandemic continues to play havoc with trade with fewer people out shopping.
With a new Welsh government department focused on climate change, it's hardly surprising that it's getting more money. What is interesting, and tells us about the departments priorities, is that of the Â£1.8bn for capital spending by the climate change minister almost all of it (Â£1.6bn) is to improve the quality and supply of housing.   
This budget is taking the long term view even though the immediate economic landscape is extremely fragile.

68,Climate change,BBC News,Calls for 'reasoned debate' over oil and gas future,2021-12-19,"Business leaders have written a joint open letter to party leaders calling for a ""reasoned debate"" over the future of oil and gas in the UK.
The call comes after plans for the controversial Cambo Oil field off Shetland were put on hold. 
The letter says any statements calling for an end to new exploration have shaken investor confidence, placing tens of thousands of jobs at risk.
It warns politicians against creating a ""hostile investment environment"".
The letter, from Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce, supported by The British Chambers of Commerce and Scottish Chambers of Commerce, has also been signed by 58 leading figures from business and civic life in Aberdeen.
It says the economic wellbeing of whole communities across the UK is also being put at risk.
The letter adds that the statements calling for an end to new exploration ""threaten the very basis of a fair and inclusive transition at the most crucial point in our collective journey to a net-zero society"". 
""A transition, by definition, is a change of state over time,"" it says. ""This is one of the most complex challenges we have faced in our history and it doesn't lend itself to a simple, 'Who's good, who's bad? Who's green, who's not?' approach. To characterise it in this way is overly simplistic. 
""We must now pause and allow for a reasoned debate about our energy future to take place. At the same time, we urge politicians to reflect carefully on their public statements on oil and gas and the impact they have on investment in the industry.
""We must not create an adverse policy environment at this crucial moment in our energy transition journey.""
The letter adds that by 2050, the International Energy Agency projects that global oil and gas demand will fall by 80%, but 20 million barrels per day will still be needed. 
""Therefore, there is no current future scenario where there is not a requirement for some oil and gas,"" it says. ""Meantime, it continues to be required for people to travel, heat and power their homes and for the manufacture of many everyday goods."" 
""This leaves us with two options; to produce this domestically, with full control over the regulatory environment in which it is extracted; or to import an increasing amount of our energy, with the heavier carbon toll that shipping it from other parts of the world carries. The latter makes little economic sense, and even less environmental sense.""
Russell Borthwick, chief executive of Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: ""We have a shared interest in getting to net zero as quickly as possible, but over recent months our region has been portrayed as part of the problem rather than part of the solution.
""The reality is that the skills, people, and experience embedded in the north-east of Scotland have quietly been leading the way in moving the UK towards its net-zero targets, without any intervention from COP26. 
""However, turning the North Sea into a hostile investment environment today does nothing to support that transition. In fact, it does the opposite, driving investment and tens of thousands of jobs away to other regions of the world.""
He added that the energy-transition opportunity for Aberdeen could be bigger than the oil and gas industry - but to get there, strong leaders were needed who were willing to ""cut through the noise, see the big picture and get our transition steps in the right order to protect jobs, provide retraining opportunities and create new ones"".
Deirdre Michie, chief executive of OGUK, which represents the UK's offshore oil and gas industry, said: ""Right now, we need oil and gas for 73% of our total energy, and so the transition to carbon neutrality will be a huge and complex task.  
""We will only be able to achieve it with careful planning by policy-makers who think long-term to develop clear government policies that are then supported by all politicians working together in the national interest. ""
She said that for years to come, oil and gas needed to be part of the energy mix. 
""It will be far better for the nation and the environment if we source these fuels from around our shores rather than relying on even more imports,""  she added.

69,Climate change,BBC News,Bangor's Hirael sea defences 'in various states of disrepair',2021-12-18,"Plans have been drawn up to build 600m (1,970ft) of new defences to protect properties from floods and rising sea levels.
Existing defences are ""in various states of disrepair"" at Hirael, in Bangor, a report submitted to Gwynedd Council has said.
The sea level is projected to rise 1.2m (3.9ft) by the end of this century, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. 
The area has previously been hit by severe flooding in 1923 and 1973.
Parts of Bangor have been identified as being at risk of flooding due to climate change.
The low-lying Hirael area faces a combination of factors, including an expected rise in sea levels and flooding the river Adda, as it empties into the sea. 
The plans at Beach Road showed the wall would be raised 1.3m (4ft 3in) above the existing level of the seafront promenade. Other plans include:
Designed by Ymgynghoriaeth Gwynedd Consultancy, the supporting documents said: ""The existing coastal defences at Hirael are limited with the only formal defences in the area being a sea wall which in various states of disrepair, a revetment and gabion baskets at the coastal frontage, north east of Beach Road. 
""Currently, there are no other structures that manage wave overtopping and inundation. 
""Temporary flood barriers such as sandbags have been deployed in the past along the length of the sea wall and two slipways to deal with high tides and wave surges but are not a sufficient source of long-term flood protection.""
It is expected that Gwynedd Council's planning department will consider the application in the coming months.

70,Climate change,Becky Morton,Climate change: How can renters make their homes warmer and greener?,2021-12-18,"Making the UK's ageing housing more energy efficient will be key to the country reaching its climate targets - but campaign groups representing renters and landlords say more action is needed to drive improvements.
""At one point you could see your breath in the living room it was that cold,"" says Erin Davy. 
The 29-year-old was renting a two-bedroom flat in Melbourn, Cambridgeshire. 
The letting agent had given an estimate of around Â£80 a month for the electricity bill. But when she moved in, her direct debit ended up being just under Â£200 a month - and over winter her monthly bill soared to as much as Â£400 a month. 
""Privately renting now is so expensive for young people as it is. Just the rent, let alone having a massive energy bill on top of it,"" she says. ""It was crippling."" 
Erin's boyfriend had lost his job at the beginning of the pandemic so the couple were relying on her wage alone to pay the bills - and she had to increase her overdraft to cover it. 
The ballooning costs meant they had to be careful about when to turn the heating on and rarely used the living room because it was so difficult to heat. 
After asking their landlord to take action he replaced their old storage heaters with newer models - but it didn't help. The problem was the flat didn't seem to stay warm at all. 
As a converted outhouse, the building was badly insulated, especially the floors and walls. 
Poor insulation doesn't just mean higher bills for renters - it also has an impact on the environment. Heating buildings contributes to almost a quarter of all UK emissions and the more heat that escapes through walls and roofs, the more energy is wasted. 
For Erin, things got so bad that she asked for an inspection by the council's environmental health team who found the inadequate heating was a health and safety hazard. 
But the more she asked their landlord to make improvements, she says, the less responsive he became. Eventually the landlord served them with an eviction notice, saying he wanted the flat back for his own use. 
Erin says the experience of being evicted was ""horrible"" but they managed to find somewhere else to live. 
""We couldn't have stayed there - we couldn't afford it,"" she says. ""I couldn't have done another winter in a freezing cold house.""
If you think your energy bills are too high or your home isn't staying warm, the first thing to do is check its energy performance certificate (EPC) online, says Dan Wilson Craw, from campaign group Generation Rent. 
Buildings are graded between A - the most energy efficient - and G. In England and Wales, homes must have a rating of at least E to be rented out, with only limited exemptions. The government has also consulted on raising the minimum standard to band C. 
In Scotland, the government plans to require privately rented properties to have a rating of at least C from 2025. 
Damp or mould is another sign that your home may be poorly insulated. 
There is government advice available online on how to make your home more energy efficient, which Mr Craw advises renters look at before approaching their landlord. 
But if landlords refuse to take action you can ask the local council to carry out an inspection. Councils are responsible for enforcing health and safety standards of homes and if they find serious issues with damp or heating, they can force the landlord to make improvements. 
Mr Craw says there are also grants and funding available through some councils and energy companies to help make your home more energy efficient if you're on a low income. 
However, research by Generation Rent suggests many renters are reluctant to demand or invest in improvements because they are unsure whether they will live in a home long enough to benefit from the cheaper bills. 
Others may be worried that if their landlord does pay for improvements, they may increase the rent to recoup costs or even evict them. 
Mr Craw says government plans to abolish section 21 ""no fault"" evictions, which would prevent landlords evicting tenants without good reason, will help give renters more certainty about how long they will be living somewhere. 
Generation Rent also supports raising minimum energy efficiency standards for rented homes - and wants tenants to be able to claim back rent if landlords break the rules. 
And the group wants to limit the amount landlords can increase rent for existing tenants to wage inflation, to avoid them upping the rent if they are forced to pay for improvements. 
For landlords, the main barrier to making improvements is cost, according to Chris Norris, from the National Residential Landlords Association. 
Nearly one in five households in England live in the private rented sector, but this type of housing tends to be older and more difficult to insulate. 
The average cost of bringing a privately rented home up to EPC C standard is Â£7,646, according to the government. 
And while landlords must pay for any changes to their property, they generally don't see the benefits of lower bills. 
Mr Norris says the grants available are quite limited. 
The government recently announced grants of Â£5,000 would be available to people in England and Wales from next April to replace their gas boilers with low-carbon heat pumps, to help cut greenhouse gas emissions. 
But heat pumps can cost between Â£6,000 and Â£18,000 - not including any expensive new insulation that may also be needed - so the subsidy would not cover the total cost. 
As well as more generous grants, the association also wants to see tax deducted from spending on energy efficiency to give landlords an extra financial incentive. 
With gas prices surging, Mr Craw says making homes more energy efficient is even more urgent. 
""If you could address it, you can improve standards of life for private renters and cut carbon emissions,"" he says. ""But it requires action from the government to do that.""

72,Storm Dennis,Matthew Murray,Climate change: Young activists snub award,2021-12-17,"Young members of an environmental group have turned down an award from a council, accusing it of not doing enough to tackle climate change.
Pontypridd's Young Friends of the Earth has been campaigning for changes to address the climate emergency. 
It said Rhondda Cynon Taf council has not done enough since the devastating floods in 2020 after Storm Dennis. 
Group member Alice, 13, said: ""It would be hypocritical for us to take the award.""
""We feel Rhondda Cynon Taf council - and the world - isn't taking action against climate change,"" she added. 
""The major changes we could do as a county would be big decisions and not small day-to-day ones. 
""Because if you sit in a house which is on fire you wouldn't just sit there as the flames surrounded you and start making a plan how you're going to deal with the fire.
""You're going to act immediately and get water and you're going to put the fire out. You wouldn't sit there doing nothing. The world isn't in the best shape and they're not doing enough about it.""
Alice added that there was ""action immediately"" when the pandemic hit, and the same needed to be done for the climate change emergency.
""We need that with climate change because if we don't get it sorted out we might not be here.""
When Storm Dennis caused widespread flooding across south Wales in February 2020, Pontypridd was one of the worst affected towns. 
Homes and businesses were hit, with the middle of the town centre flooded after the River Taff burst its banks. 
""When we saw the town flood last year we knew climate change was getting worse and despite what people were saying about it getting better because it's not,"" said Alice. 
""I felt terrified when I saw water running down the main street because if water can reach that high because of a storm, imagine what it will be like in 10 years.""
Dan, 12, another member of Young Friends of the Earth, said: ""I would have expected Rhondda Cynon Taf council to declare a climate emergency after the Welsh government did. 
""They are one of the few councils in Wales not to declare it and after Storm Dennis I'd have thought it would have been the first thing they would have done. 
""I fear, with the melting ice caps, much of the Welsh coast and RCT will get completely flooded and we'll lose whole towns and people's homes. So we need to take action so we don't lose all the history too.""
Rowan, 10, said they thought it would generate more publicity to turn down the award than accept it.
""I don't think people understand how bad things are. I find it traumatising, when I think to the future.
""I might have a future with crumbling mountains and suffocating air, and I don't want that to happen.""
Council leader Andrew Morgan replied to a letter from the group declining the award, saying the council is committed to achieving net zero by 2030 and ""has already made progress towards achieving this commitment to meet and contribute to global, national and local targets"".

A cross-party task group has spent almost two years exploring what Preston City Council needs to do to fulfil the pledge made in April 2019.
The report said decisions would have to be taken ensure ""the greatest carbon reduction can be achieved at the earliest opportunity"".
But its fleet of 124 vehicles will remain diesel-driven.
Councillors voted for the authority to invest a further Â£4.8m over the next five years in replacing the vehicles, but an accompanying report said it was not currently possible to purchase ""alternative fuelled"" vehicles, because of the lack of the necessary infrastructure to operate them.
Environment and community safety cabinet member Robert Boswell defended the decision not to shift the fleet to electric at this point, warning that if the council had to charge all of its vehicles ""there might be power failures in Preston, because there [are] other factors [to consider]"".
He suggested that the authority faced the same practical barriers to electric vehicles that were experienced by some members of the public, including a lack of charging points.
""The new vehicles that we will be moving to, though not electronic vehicles, have a reduction in emissions and have potential [for] fuel savings and more efficient engines,"" he said.
Liberal Democrat group leader John Potter branded the report ""disappointing"" and said the council would not achieve its carbon-cutting aims.
However, the Labour chair of the task group, James Hull, said it demonstrated that the authority would have a ""robust climate change agenda"" at the forefront of all its work.
The main recommendation - to create a cabinet member responsible for tackling climate change - has already been implemented by the Labour-run council back in the summer, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
The task group report noted the need for the council to focus on its own carbon emissions, other local emissions that it can directly influence through its policies and community emissions that can be cut through partnerships between the council and other organisations.
It also suggested that the council carries out a study to explore whether it is feasible to maximise heat recovery at the city's crematorium in order to make it more energy efficient.

74,COP26,Steffan Messenger,Climate change: Wales COP26 events 'costly failure',2021-12-16,"A series of events held in Wales to coincide with the COP26 climate summit has been branded a costly ""failure"" by the Welsh Conservatives.
Figures obtained by the party show the Welsh government spent Â£235,000 on COP Cymru.
But the Tories claim the programme of debates and lectures resulted in little public or media interest.
The Welsh government said more than 3,800 people had attended the events online.
The series started days before the summit in Glasgow with the launch of the Welsh government's Net Zero plan - with a panel session in Port Talbot streamed live to a virtual audience.
A roadshow followed during COP26 itself- with four debate and discussion events held in different parts of Wales looking at energy, nature, climate change adaptation and transport.
This was followed by a Wales Climate Week at the end of November - a five-day programme of virtual events.  
A breakdown of the costs involved provided by the Welsh government show Â£53,600 was spent on staging and sound requirements, up to Â£135,000 on staffing and event management, Â£9,500 on a COP Cymru online platform, up to Â£23,000 on press and marketing, with about Â£13,490 on other costs.
Well-known Welsh presenters and journalists were invited to chair the discussions, which featured leading experts in environmental issues, as well as government ministers.
Recordings of each session have been posted online - while viewing figures are not visible, all of the videos bar one have yet to receive a single comment or ""like"".
The Tories alleged that COP Cymru had been used for ""rhetoric not action"" and had resulted in ""little to no new policy"" announcements beyond the initial Net Zero plan.  
Their climate change spokesperson in the Senedd, Janet Finch-Saunders MS said the whole thing had been a ""failure"".
""It's highly disappointing that hard earned taxpayer money was spent on events that were little more than self-promotion and ego stroking,"" she said. 
She claimed funding had been ""frittered away"" and that it would have been better spent on shoring up coal tips, which was ""such a priority for the people of Wales"".
But climate scientist Professor Mary Gagen of Swansea University said aspects of the criticism had ""made her blood boil"".
She was involved in several COP Cymru events, as well as producing a guide for Welsh schools on climate change and videos showcasing the efforts of university researchers in the field.
""What I thought was a real shame was saying that, because these weren't flashy media events that they weren't inspiring and weren't able to make a difference,"" she said.
""It's the exact opposite - what leads to positive change are those little moments where a school child is able to meet with a scientist, where a farmer is able to ask a question, they're never going to make the front page but they're really meaningful.
""For me COP Cymru generated thousands and thousands of those moments.""
Dr Anna Bullen of the Centre for Alternative Technology who also chaired one of the events said the livestreaming element made it ""hard to gauge"" how they were being received.
""Of course I want to see as much public engagement as possible but I wouldn't use that as a sole reason to end an event like this.""
""For our sector bringing together practitioners and experts, sharing views, understanding and research is so important,"" she said.
A spokesperson for the Welsh government said COP Cymru included an extensive programme of events, attracting more than 3,800 virtual attendees, 200 speakers and 38 sessions.
""Several fringe events were also held as there was too much demand for content to fit into a single programme,"" they said.
He added that if the government was to meet its net zero targets it was ""crucial we engage with people, businesses and organisations across Wales"".
""COP26 provided an international platform to show Wales is playing its part in tackling the threats of climate change and that we are listening and learning from experiences elsewhere,"" they said.
""COP Cymru brought the conversation closer to home and was an important opportunity to engage citizens across Wales, helping them understand the need for collective action and the role they can play."" 
On coal tip safety, he added it was the UK Government that was ""unwilling to take responsibility"" for the restoration work costs, currently estimated to be at least Â£500m.

75,COP26,Kayleen Devlin,The teenagers and the nun trying to stop an Australian coal mine,2021-12-15,"When eight teenagers and an elderly nun in Australia teamed up for a climate case, they won, in a historic judgement. Their case has now been appealed by the country's government. If the final verdict swings in their favour, it will have ramifications not just for Australian law but for climate cases world-wide. 
In May this year, Anjali Sharma was sitting in her economics class at school in Melbourne when the court in Sydney live-streamed the results of a climate case she had found herself at the centre of. It took a while to sink in. 
""To me it all just sounded like jargon. It took a briefing from my legal team to understand the magnitude of what had happened,"" she says. 
At that moment 17-year-old Ms Sharma and the seven other teenagers involved in her case had made history. Alongside 87-year-old Catholic nun Brigid Arthur, who acted as the young people's legal guardian, they'd taken Australia's environment minister, Sussan Ley, to court - and won.
""It felt really rewarding to be able to engage in something so historic for Australia, and needed too,"" says Ms Sharma.
Their case attempted to stop the expansion of the Vickery coal mine in New South Wales, which is estimated to add an extra 170 million tonnes of fossil fuel emissions to the atmosphere. 
The judge in their case, Mordy Bromberg, ruled that the government had a duty to protect young people against future harm related to climate change. It's the first time in the world that a duty of care of this kind has been recognised.
Justice Bromberg did not, however, grant them an injunction to prevent the expansion of the mine. In his view, the court didn't have any evidence that Sussan Ley would actually approve the extension, and any injunction would be pre-emptive.
Yet in September Ms Ley approved the extension of the Vickery coal mine, as well as three others since then. The government is also appealing the decision in the Sharma case - the outcome of which is due soon.
The government used a ""substitution argument"" as one reason to approve Vickery, says the lawyer representing the Sharma case, David Barnden.
""It's the argument that if this particular coal project didn't go ahead, it wouldn't make a difference to the total amount of emissions because effectively the market would fulfill that demand. That's otherwise known as the drug dealer's defence - it's the idea that 'If I don't deal drugs then somebody else will.'""
For Sister Brigid Arthur, the minister's decisions since the success of their case are ""quite provocative"".
Sister Arthur has spent a lifetime working with young people. For over two decades she has been acting as a litigation guardian - instructing lawyers on behalf of those who can't represent themselves - in cases mostly involving refugees. Before that she was a secondary school teacher. This is her first environmental case. 
""It's engaged young people in a way that seems quite extraordinary. It's certainly for me something new,"" she says.
She was approached by lawyers just over a year ago who asked her to act as the teenagers' litigation guardian. She didn't take much convincing.
""I'm pretty passionate about climate change and while I don't work directly in this area, I'm very conscious of the fact that it's important for people to do what they can.
""Young people are the ones who will inherit whatever we're doing now, so they have every right to be calling people to account.""
In speaking out, Ms Sharma has made herself a target for attacks.
""I've been messaged a lot of threats,"" she says.
""Some of the big news sources in Australia have, I guess, quite a right-wing following, so when news sources like that have covered my story I learned really quickly not to read the comments.""
A 2019 report which investigated four publications owned by Australia's most powerful media company, News Corp Australia, argued that they promoted climate scepticism. Of over 8,000 articles analysed, 45% of all items either rejected or cast doubt upon consensus scientific findings.
In response, a News Corp Australia spokesman said the year-old report was ""imbalanced"" and coming from ""a political activist group with a history of bias against our company's journalism"".
News Corp Australia recently has been viewed as softening its hostility towards climate action by advocating for net zero emissions by 2050.
Despite this, shortly before and during COP26, videos from News Corp-owned Sky News Australia were recycled and found traction on social media amongst climate sceptics.
One Sky News Australia segment in which the host condemns youth climate activists as ""selfish, badly educated, virtue-signalling little turds"" was shared by the head of the advocacy group the CO2 coalition and received over 45,000 likes and 16,000 retweets.
As the science of climate change has become harder to argue with, a growing and common tactic is often to shoot the messenger instead - often accusing them of hypocrisy. 
""Comments like 'Oh, she's wearing jeans and I bet she doesn't know how much water goes into producing a pair of jeans,'"" says Ms Sharma. ""And you know, they're right. I do own a pair of jeans. But me not owning that pair of jeans is not going to cut Australia's emissions in half by 2030.""

When Sister Brigid first met the teenagers, who knew each other through attending climate protests, she was struck by their passion. She describes them as a group of young people ""who really believe in this, who feel like they can't stop"".
""There are very few greys with young people,"" she says. ""Everything is so black and white.""
But for now, all they can do is wait for the result of the appeal to be announced.
Despite widespread recognition of the need to move away from coal, there are different approaches when it comes to putting that knowledge into practice. At the COP26 summit in Glasgow, coal became a point of contention after delegates from China and India requested a last-minute change to the agreement, switching the phrase ""phase out"" coal with ""phase down"".
The results of the appeal and their case could be game-changing - not only for Australia but for other parts of the world too.
A success in their case could signal an erosion in support for fossil fuel burning and extraction with more lawsuits of this kind ahead. But if the minister's appeal is successful, it could see courts effectively vacate the climate field.
Australia is the world's second-largest exporter of coal. Following the Glasgow summit, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the coal industry will be operating in the country for ""decades to come"". He added that the plan to achieve net zero by 2050 will not come at the cost of rural and regional Australians. 
""The world is grappling with this collective action problem of climate change. Every mine has its part to play and every decision counts,"" says Mr Barnden.
""What the court found was that the emissions from this particular extension project could be the emissions that tip us over the edge to these nonlinear tipping points which would further accelerate climate change.""
He hopes that the duty of care ruling - if maintained through the appeal process - can influence other jurisdictions and give hope to young people to be able to participate in the legal process.
""It's a very foundational legal case to approach the problems caused by climate change, and the principles of negligence exist in a whole range of common law countries, from the UK, to New Zealand, Canada and the US as well.""
It's too soon to tell whether this case will provide a turning point on climate inaction. But for Ms Sharma and the other teenagers involved in her case, the time for action is now.
""I really hope the federal court realises that Australia is now running behind the rest of the world, and that the duty of care that my case seeks to establish is really, really needed right now.""

76,Climate change,BBC News,Insulate Britain activists vow to continue breaking law,2021-12-14,"An Insulate Britain protestor says she will continue breaking the law to convince the government to fix Britain's ""leaky homes"".
Anglican priest Reverend Sue Parfitt, 79, told the Royal Courts of Justice that it was of ""no consequence"" if she was jailed for breaching a High Court injunction by blocking a highway.
Seven members of the climate group appeared and admitted the allegations.
They are set to be sentenced on Wednesday.
The breaches relate to an Insulate Britain protest on the M25, which led to tailbacks of 2.5 miles (4km), when activists blocked the carriageways and glued themselves to the road.
Rev Parfitt, from Bristol, was applauded by members of the public when she addressed the judge about her determination to continue protesting in the event she is not jailed.
She told the court: ""It is of no consequence to me what you do with me today.
""If you leave me at liberty, I shall continue to protest in whatever way most dramatically draws attention to the plight we are all in - whether that involves breaking the law or not.""
Stephen Pritchard, 62, from Radstock in Somerset, said he ""will continue to block roads in peaceful protest regardless of the consequences for me personally"".
Steve Gower, 54, from Gloucester, claimed that he protested ""on behalf of people present and future not in a position to make their voices heard"".
He added: ""I will sleep tonight and thereafter with a clear conscience.""

77,Climate change,BBC News,"Arctic heat record is like Mediterranean, says UN",2021-12-14,"The highest temperature ever recorded in the Arctic, 38C (100F), has been officially confirmed, sounding ""alarm bells"" over Earth's changing climate.
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) on Tuesday verified the record, reported in the Siberian town of Verkhoyansk on 20 June last year. 
The temperature was 18C higher than the area's average daily maximum for June.
The WMO, a UN agency, said the extreme heat was ""more befitting the Mediterranean than the Arctic"".
It is the first time the agency has included the Arctic Circle in its archive of extreme weather reports.
The WMO said the 38C temperature was measured at a meteorological station during ""an exceptional and prolonged Siberian heatwave"".
Last year's extreme heat in the region contributed to the spread of wildfires, which swept across the forests and peatlands of northern Russia releasing record amounts of carbon.
While relatively common in summer months, high temperatures and strong winds made the fires unusually severe.
The high temperatures across Siberia led to ""massive sea ice loss"" and played a major role in 2020 being one of the three warmest years on record, the WMO said.
The agency said its verification of the Verkhoyansk record highlighted how temperatures were increasing in a climatically important region of the world. 
""This new Arctic record is one of a series of observations reported to the WMO archive of Weather and Climate Extremes that sound the alarm bells about our changing climate,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.
Mr Taalas told the BBC that melting snow and ice in the Russian Arctic were boosting warming. 
""This is very much caused by changes in the radiation properties of the soil and the ocean... once we had snow cover, the radiation properties of the surface is very different from the dark soil or open sea,"" he said.
The WMO said it had added the Arctic Circle to its World Weather and Climate Extremes archive under a new category for high temperatures in the region.
The Arctic is one of the fastest warming regions in the world, heating at more than twice the global average, the WMO said. 
Warming in the Arctic is leading to the thawing of once permanently frozen permafrost below ground.
This is alarming scientists because as permafrost thaws, carbon dioxide and methane previously locked up below ground is released.
These greenhouse gases can cause further warming, and further thawing of the permafrost, in a vicious cycle known as positive feedback.
The higher temperatures also cause land ice in the Arctic to melt at a faster rate, leading to greater run-off into the ocean where it contributes to sea-level rise.
Human activity is contributing to a rise in world temperatures, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life.
Left unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species.

79,Climate change,athan Amos,Thwaites: Antarctic glacier heading for dramatic change,2021-12-14,"Scientists are warning of dramatic changes at one of the biggest glaciers in Antarctica, potentially within the next five to 10 years.
They say a floating section at the front of Thwaites Glacier that until now has been relatively stable could ""shatter like a car windscreen"". 
US and UK researchers are currently engaged in an intense study programme at Thwaites because of its melt rate. 
Already it is dumping 50 billion tonnes of ice into the ocean each year.
This is having limited impact on global sea-levels today, but there is sufficient ice held upstream in the glacier's drainage basin to raise the height of the oceans by 65cm - were it all to melt.
Such a ""doomsday"" scenario is unlikely to come about for many centuries, but the study team says Thwaites is now responding to a warming world in really quite rapid ways.
""There is going to be dramatic change in the front of the glacier, probably in less than a decade. Both published and unpublished studies point in that direction,"" said glaciologist Prof Ted Scambos, US lead coordinator for the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC). 
""This will accelerate the pace (of Thwaites) and widen, effectively, the dangerous part of the glacier,"" he told BBC News.
Thwaites is a colossus. It's roughly the size of Great Britain, or Florida, and its outflow speed has doubled in the past 30 years.
The ITGC has established how this is happening. It is the result of warm ocean water getting under - and melting - Thwaites's floating front, or ice shelf as it's known.
The warm water is thinning and weakening this ice, making it run faster and pushing back the zone where the main glacier body becomes buoyant.
At the moment, the leading edge of the eastern ice shelf is pinned in place by an offshore underwater ridge, which means its flow speed is a third of that seen in the ice shelf's western sector which has no such constraint.
But the ITGC team says the eastern shelf is likely to become uncoupled from the ridge in the next few years which will destabilise it. And even if the pinning persists, the ongoing development of fractures in the shelf ice will almost certainly break up the area anyway.

""I visualise it somewhat similar to that car window where you have a few cracks that are slowly propagating, and then suddenly you go over a bump in your car and the whole thing just starts to shatter in every direction,"" explained Dr Erin Pettit from Oregon State University.
The affected area is very small when considered in the context of the glacier as a whole, but it is the shift to a new regime and what this means for further ice loss that is the real significance.
At present, the eastern shelf, which has a width of about 40km, moves forward at about 600m per year. The coming change in status will probably see the following ice jump in speed to about 2km per year - the same as the current velocity recorded in the 80km-wide western sector.
Jointly funded by the US National Science Foundation and the UK's Natural Environment Research Council, the five-year ITGC project is putting Thwaites under unprecedented scrutiny. 
Each Antarctic summer season, teams of scientists are investigating the glacier's behaviour in every way possible. From satellite, on the ice, and from ships in front of Thwaites.
Those teams are en route for the new season right now, some in Covid quarantine ahead of their deployment to the field.
One of the projects for the New Year will see the tubby yellow submarine known as ""Boaty McBoatface"" dive under Thwaites' floating ice to gather data on water temperature, current direction and turbulence - all factors that influence melting.
The autonomous vehicle will go on missions lasting one to four days, navigating its own path through the cavity beneath the shelf. This is high risk as the seafloor terrain is extremely rugged. 
""It's scary. We might not get Boaty back,"" conceded Dr Alex Phillips from the UK's National Oceanography Centre.  
""We've put a lot of effort this past year into developing collision avoidance for the vehicle, to make sure it doesn't crash into the seabed. We also have contingencies whereby if it does get into trouble, it can retrace its steps and retreat to safety.""
The latest science on Thwaites Glacier is being presented this week at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in New Orleans.

80,Climate change,Jake Horton and Esme Stallard,US tornadoes: Is climate change to blame?,2021-12-13,"Several US states have been hit by a devastating series of tornadoes, with an expected death toll of more than 100.
These are extremely rare outside the spring and summer, in the US, but this December there has been a record number of tornado warnings. 
So is climate change causing more frequent and stronger tornadoes?
When warm moist air is trapped by cooler air, it causes thunder clouds to form.
The warm air rises, creating an updraft. 
And if there are also strong winds moving in different directions, the air column starts to rotate.
Increasing amounts of warm air are drawn in, speeding up the wind spiral, which then extends out of the bottom of the thunder clouds. 
And once this touches the ground, it is a tornado. 
There is more warm moist air in the hotter months.
And a cluster of tornadoes of this size and power in December is extremely unusual in the US.
Far more tornadoes have been recorded in the past 20 years than the previous 20 - but some of this is due to improved tracking.
As data-collecting methods have improved, less severe tornadoes have been recorded more consistently.
""To an untrained eye, it may look like we are having more of these events happening - but in reality what is happening is we have much better tools for identifying relatively weaker tornadoes,"" Dr Jana Houser, professor of meteorology, at the University of Ohio, says.
But clusters of tornadoes - when six or more start within six hours of each other - are becoming more likely.
And though there are now fewer days with tornadoes - on average about 100 compared with 150 in the 1970s - there are more tornadoes on those days.
No single weather event can be put down to climate change alone.
The increasing amount of tornado clusters ""clearly implies that the patterns of the atmosphere have changed"", meteorologist Harold Brooks, at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), says. 
""That may be related to climate change - but we cannot make a full conclusion,"" he adds.
Warmer temperatures make extreme weather events more likely and potentially more destructive.
But ""there is no scientific consensus"" on tornadoes, Mr Brooks says.
""It is not like the consensus on the increase in heatwaves or heavy rain at all.""
Wind speed and energy in the atmosphere are two of the main drivers of tornadoes - but there is a lack of definitive evidence on how they may change with a warming climate.  
At a briefing following the tornadoes, US President Joe Biden said he would ""be asking the Environmental Protection Agency and others to take a look at [the role of climate change].
""The fact is that we know everything is more intense when the climate is warming,"" he added.
In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found some ""conditions conducive to tornadoes such as atmospheric instability [will] increase due to increasing temperature and humidity"". 
But other conditions, which may lessen the likelihood of tornadoes, also exist.
There is no evidence tornadoes are becoming stronger, according to National Geographic Society research.
In fact, the US had had a ""tornado drought"", with no highest-category tornado since 2013. 
The most devastating of this weekend's tornadoes has become known as the Quad-State - cutting a swathe through Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky. 
It is not the wind speeds, though, that were record-breaking but its size.
It was reportedly three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) wide and travelled for more than 220 miles - considerably further than the distance from London to Paris.
On average, tornadoes are 50 yards wide and travel only a few miles, according to the National US Weather Service.
The most frequent tornadoes have traditionally been in a strip through the central US known as Tornado Alley.
This includes areas of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska.
But some evidence points towards a shift to having more tornadoes in the southern US.
Mr Brooks says: ""Tornado Alley is not well defined, so that is hard to say - if there is a definite shift.
""We have seen an increase in tornadoes of about 10% over 40 years in the mid-South region and a decrease in the Texas, Kansas sort of region. 
""It has shifted - but it is not a huge shift.""

81,Climate change,BBC News,Wind-powered net zero McDonald's opens in Market Drayton,2021-12-10,"A net zero carbon McDonald's has opened in what the company believes is a UK first.
The wind turbine and solar panel-powered restaurant is in Market Drayton, Shropshire.
Recycled IT equipment and household goods make up the building's cladding, signs are from used coffee beans and insulation is provided by sheep wool.
The fast-food company said it would be used as a ""blueprint"" for other sites and work has started to roll it out.
Net zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
It is the first restaurant in the UK due to be verified as net zero emissions for construction using the UK Green Building Council's (UKGBC's) net zero carbon buildings framework.  
The problems of decarbonising the construction industry were ""complex"", but the move by McDonald's was a ""critical first step"", UKGBC spokesman Simon McWhirter said.
McDonald's spokeswoman Beth Hart said: ""We've already started to roll out some of these innovations to other restaurants, but what is exciting about Market Drayton is the fact it will act as a blueprint for our future new builds.
""We believe that our food needs to be served in restaurants that are sustainable for the future. Market Drayton is a big step towards making that a reality.""
Senior lecturer in the environment and sustainability at Keele University, Dr Sharon George, said the move was a ""positive step"" and a sign that the company was recognising that ""society's view of sustainability"" was changing. 
McDonald's and other fast food suppliers have previously come under fire from investors who signed a letter asking the firms to reduce the carbon footprint of their meat and dairy supply chains.
The firm has said it has put in place strong climate targets for suppliers.

83,Storm Barra,BBC News,Logan Botanic Garden counts cost of Storm Barra damage,2021-12-10,"A botanic garden in south west Scotland is counting the cost of the damage caused by Storm Barra.
Curator Richard Baines said the destruction at the Port Logan site was ""heart-breaking"".
Logan Botanic Garden was in one of the areas worst affected by the storm on Tuesday, with wind gusts of more than 75mph (120kmh).
Mr Baines said it had caused damage to ""countless plants"" as well as the destruction of ""several prized trees"".
Logan, situated in Dumfries and Galloway, is a regional garden of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RGBE).
Among the trees damaged by the storm was one of the garden's best-known attractions, Polylepsis australis - known locally as the ""filo pastry tree"" because of its peeling bark.
The tree, runner-up in the 2018 Scottish Tree of the Year contest, had two large boughs torn from its trunk.
Experts said it would survive but had ""lost its majestic stature"".
Mr Baines said the damage had highlighted, with a ""ferocious roar"", the impact of climate change.
""This is the fiercest storm I have experienced in my 15 years as curator of the garden and it's heart-breaking to witness the damage and destruction of so many important trees,"" he said.
""It's another clear example of the impact of climate change on our natural environment and why the work of RGBE in researching and helping to conserve biodiversity is so crucial.""
The garden is home to 120 species that are threatened with extinction out of about 2,500 species in total.
It usually enjoys an ""almost subtropical climate"" allowing plants to flourish which would not survive elsewhere.
However, the wind direction and strength of Storm Barra caused significant damage, despite hedges which had been planted for protection.
Several eucalypts, wild-collected in Tasmania, were destroyed as were specimens of the critically-endangered Araucaria angustifolia (Brazilian pine), Acacia (florist's mimosa) and Callitris (cypress).
RBGE said these were trees which thrived at Logan but were hardly grown outside anywhere else in Scotland.
Scotland's national collection of Leptospermum scoparium or tea tree, which is hosted at the garden, was also affected with several trees blown out of the ground by the winds.
It has been estimated it will take about three weeks to clear up the damage and debris from the garden which is scheduled to reopen to the public on 1 March next year.

84,Climate change,BBC News,Climate change: Four cheap ways to save energy at home,2021-12-10,"Making your home more energy efficient can be costly and may not be possible if you're renting, or you don't have thousands of pounds stashed away to buy new heat pumps and double glazing.
But there are some cheap solutions to try to save money. We've looked at where you are likely to be losing the most energy in your home and come up with some simple solutions to help save money on your bills and keep warm this winter.
Warm air wants to leave your home and will find any nook and cranny to do so. As it does, cold air is sucked in to replace it, causing draughts. It makes your home cold and wastes energy.
Shutting doors and closing windows may not be enough as any gaps in the frames allow warm air to escape - and that costs money. On this thermal image, the draughts show up as the coldest areas around a front door.
The coolest temperatures are black, purple and blue and the draughts are shown around the door in these colours, says James Richardson, of IRT Surveys - which uses thermal imaging to help home owners identify where heat is being lost.
The letter box, often an escape route for hot air, appears warm (red and yellow colours) so it is likely to be well-sealed and insulated. 
But by simply adding a draught excluder - or even a rolled up towel - the draughts can be blocked, as we can see in these before and after images:
Energy firms and energy-saving campaigners agree one of the simplest solutions to keeping out the cold is to use a draught excluder. Combined with draught-proofing of windows and doors, it could help cut around Â£25 a year off your bills. Special care needs to be taken in houses that have flueless gas appliances, which need some ventilation to operate safely.
Having a rolled-up towel by the front door may not be the most attractive household feature, but you can always try to make and decorate one yourself.
It is important to make sure the draught excluder covers the width of the door. And for a no-sew method, use strips of the discarded material to make ties and tie up each end of the trouser leg instead.
If you don't fancy cutting up your jeans you could just use a rectangular piece of material to make a tube and fill in a similar fashion. You'll end up with a more regular-shaped excluder.
For the really crafty, or Team GB Olympic gold medal-winning divers perhaps, Home Energy Scotland have a pattern for a knitted version.
Badly fitting windows or single panes of glass are another place heat is often lost. 
If you can't get windows replaced with double glazing, the Energy Saving Trust says it is worth getting some heavy curtains to help keep the heat in the room.
Again, the thermal images show how closing the curtains traps that heat in with you.
You may not want to sit in the dark all day, so look out for cheap DIY kits available that use a thin plastic sheet to cover the window, blocking draughts.
They are sometimes shrink-fitted into place with a hairdryer and can be removed and replaced as required.
Insulating your loft is like wearing a woolly hat - trapping the warmth below to keep you cosy. However, that hatch is just like any other door and needs attention too.
Even James was surprised by the thermal image showing heat being lost around the frame. But it's an easy fix, making sure it is snugly insulated around the edges.
One suggestion online is to glue a plastic bag to the back of the hatch, fill it some of the loft insulation and then seal it up. It should help insulate the hatch and flop over the edges when you pull it shut, stopping draughts escaping.
There are lots of little things we can do around the home that will help save energy and money that just require tweaks to our behaviour rather than installing, fitting or making anything.
Most energy companies will install a smart meter for free so you can help monitor your energy use and spending. 
But there are other small changes to your daily routine that cost nothing and save energy. The obvious ones are spending less time in the shower (potentially saving about Â£10 a year), turning off the lights (Â£14) or turning down the thermostat (saving up toÂ£55).
The Eco-Experts blog recommends ""heating the humans, not the building"" - so perhaps don't keep the central heating on all the time if you're not cold, and don't heat rooms you're not in. 
Other ideas include:
And finally there is the old favourite - repeated by parents down the ages and still on the advice the elderly by Age UK - if you're cold, put on an extra layer - several thin layers of clothing will keep you warmer than one thick layer, as the layers trap warm air between them.

85,California wildfires,BBC News,Father and son arrested on suspicion of starting Caldor fire,2021-12-09," A father and son have been arrested on suspicion of starting a massive blaze that tore through northern California earlier this year. 
But David Scott Smith, 66, and Travis Shane Smith, 32, were poised to dispute accusations of ""reckless arson"" related to the Caldor Fire. 
They are being held on $1m (Â£760,000) bail and have not yet been charged.
The Caldor scorched more than 220,000 acres over two months.
It grew to become the 15th largest fire ever recorded in California, razing over 1,000 structures, injuring five people and forcing thousands to flee before it was contained in October.
After their arrest on Wednesday, Mark Reichel, attorney for the Smiths, told The New York Times that the pair were baffled by the suggestion that they were responsible for the fire. 
They had been in Eldorado National Forest this past summer when they spotted a fire, Mr Reichel said. They tried to call 911 but could not find signal. 
""As we sit here tonight, we have no idea what the prosecution's theory is on how the fire started,"" he told the newspaper. 
The El Dorado County District Attorney's Office did not provide details about what the men were accused of having done. The Smiths were arrested on a ""Ramey warrant"", which is when someone is taken into custody before charges are filed. 
In a statement, the DA's office said they were accused of violating a section of state law commonly referred to as ""reckless arson"", which caused inhabited buildings to burn and resulted in great bodily injury to multiple victims. 
""About 95% of fires are human caused"", said Nick Schuler of Cal Fire, California's biggest fire agency. ""That doesn't mean intentionally caused.""
Dry, hot weather has left conditions ""so critical"" that person driving home from a camping trip pulling a trailer along a roadway could cause ""dozens"" of fire, Mr Schuler told the BBC. 
In California, about 10% of wildfires are set intentionally, according to the agency. 
Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.
The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

86,Climate change,BBC News,Longannet power station chimney blown up,2021-12-09,"The 600ft chimney at the former Longannet power station has been demolished in an explosion.
The Fife site produced Scotland's last coal-fired energy until it ceased operation in 2016.
The chimney was the largest free-standing structure in Scotland and was a local landmark for generations.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon pushed the button to ignite 700kg of explosives, bringing down the chimney stack.
Ms Sturgeon said: ""Today's event is a symbolic reminder that we have ended coal-fired power generation in Scotland, as we work in a fair and just way towards becoming a net-zero nation by 2045.
""Our goal is to generate 50% of overall energy consumption from renewable sources by 2030, and Scotland's energy sector is well placed to deliver on the key investments in renewables, hydrogen and energy storage required to achieve this.
""Growth in these sectors over the next decade will be transformative for Scotland, delivering further good, green jobs, strengthened energy security, and benefits for local communities as we decarbonise industry and society to mitigate the worst effects of climate change, in a way that leaves no-one behind.""
Owner Scottish Power had projected the environmental slogan ""Make Coal History"" onto the chimney at night ahead of the demolition. 
Longannet was once the largest coal-fired power station in Europe. Its buildings have been removed in a series of controlled explosions in the years since it closed.
As well as the environmental slogan, multi-coloured ""global warming stripes"", created by Professor Ed Hawkins of Reading University, were also projected onto the chimney.
Scottish Power said the stripes showed the change in global temperature from 1850 to 2020, with shades of blue showing cooler-than-average years, and red showing years that were hotter-than-average.
Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, said: ""At Cop26 in Glasgow, we were proud to show the world that Scotland has already made coal history.
""As a 100% energy company, we are committed to helping the UK end its reliance on fossil fuels.
""For half a century, Longannet's chimney has dominated the Firth of Forth skyline. We bade farewell to that landmark today - however this is a landmark day for Scotland too.
""Watching the chimney of Scotland's last coal-fired station fall today represents a real milestone, as the UK moves away from the large polluting power stations of the past and accelerates down the road to net-zero emissions.""
The demolition marks an important moment in Scotland's energy transition but it's only a symbolic one.
That's because it's more than five years since coal was last burnt to generate our domestic electricity.
But symbolism is important since a few short miles away politicians spent two weeks in November trying to convince other countries to do the same.
So, why have we been able to do it now when countries like India and China are struggling?
Investment is one thing but another major reason is transition fuels like North Sea gas and nuclear.
But in 2019 we generated 97% of our net electricity demand from renewables with huge amounts of offshore wind in the planning stages.
For us the revolution is already happening but the hope now is that the rest of the developing word skips that middle step and switches straight to renewables. 
Longannet began generation in 1970 and Scottish Power said it was the largest coal-fired power station in Europe when first built, remaining the largest in Scotland until it closed on 31 March 2016.
At the height of operations, it burned coal from around the world including from as far away as Russia and Colombia, as well as from Scottish open-cast mines.
Typically, it consumed four million tonnes of coal per year and at full production could make enough electricity to power two million homes.
The demolition of Longannet is being carried out by Scottish Power contractor Brown and Mason and work to remove materials at the site will continue into 2022.
Ignacio Galan, chairman of Scottish Power and Iberdrola, said: ""Longannet played an important role in Scotland's history as its largest coal station, but the future can only be about clean energy.
""Everyone working at Scottish Power and the wider Iberdrola Group should be proud to be contributing to this impressive transition from fossil fuels to renewables.""
Lang Banks, director of WWF Scotland, said: ""It's an historic moment to see the chimney of Scotland's last coal-fired power station come down.
""We have successfully made coal power history in Scotland and rapid progress is now being made globally towards cleaner, renewable energy.""

Councillors were told 900 properties owned by Colchester Borough Council would not meet standards after the authority refused an opportunity to apply for retrofit funding. 
The authority voted to promote the government's Green Homes grant instead.
The government wants all homes to reach at least a C rating by 2035.
The authority was told 900 of the council's 5,800-strong housing stock had a rating of D or below, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
Council documents state that the Green Homes grant scheme offers a maximum of Â£10,000 per household towards improving energy efficiency and is targeted towards low income households.
The energy ratings grade the performance of homes' energy efficiency, with A being the most efficient and G being the least.
While applications for the Green Homes Grant closed nationally in March 2021, homeowners and landlords can still apply for the local authority delivery of the scheme.
The council also resolved to working with private landlords and housing associations to ensure the target is met.

88,Climate change,Esme Stallard and Wanyuan Song,Indonesia's biodiesel drive is leading to deforestation,2021-12-08,"Indonesia pledged at the recent COP26 climate summit that its greenhouse gas emissions would peak by 2030 and then start to fall. 
It's also said that it will end deforestation by that same date.
But to reduce emissions from its transport sector, it's relying on using more biofuels - production of which can lead to the loss of forested land.
So how can it both curb its emissions using biofuels and end deforestation by 2030?
Indonesia is now the third largest producer of biofuels in the world, behind Brazil and the US, and the world's largest producer of biodiesel - a biofuel alternative to regular diesel fuel.
Biofuels come from plant material and animal waste, and can be used to power vehicles or for heating and electricity. 
They are considered a renewable alternative to traditional fossil fuels (coal, petrol and diesel) as they can be replenished quicker and release fewer greenhouse gases. 
Indonesia produces biodiesel from crops, primarily palm oil, and government policy stipulates that all diesel fuel must contain a mix of at least 30% biodiesel - to rise to 50% by 2025.
The transport sector accounts for 13.6% of the country's emissions and 45% of its energy consumption. The government believes this policy could reduce their transport emissions by 36 million tonnes of CO2 by 2040.
But taken along with an expected 6% annual growth in its vehicle fleet, it means biofuel production will need to increase by nearly 50% over the next three years to meet demand. 
This would require a substantial increase in land used for biofuel production, perhaps by as much as 1.2 million hectares - to about a quarter of all palm oil cultivation in the country.
In theory, biofuels should reduce emissions compared with fossil fuels because when biofuel crops grow, they absorb carbon from the atmosphere which is then released through burning - meaning there is no net increase in emissions. 
The crops can then be replanted and the process started again. 
However, problems arise because of land clearing such as deforestation, which is needed to grow these crops.
Forests are one of the most effective systems at absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, far more so than crops. 
Replacing them with biofuel crops means less CO2 is absorbed, and this leads to an increase of greenhouse gases - contributing to global warming.
So when forested land is cleared - as opposed to using existing agricultural land - to grow soybean or palm oil it can end up producing more emissions for each unit of energy than diesel.
The government has tried to implement measures for the sustainable management of its forests. However, earlier this year it failed to extend a ban on new palm oil plantations.
Indonesia pledged to end deforestation by 2030 at COP26, but afterwards, its environment minister said the promise was ""clearly inappropriate and unfair"".  
In a BBC interview in October, Indonesian President Joko Widodo defended his country's deforestation record, and said it had ""rehabilitated a lot of hectares"" of forests.
It's true the annual rate of deforestation has come down. But Indonesia continues to be one of the world's top three countries for the amount of forest loss, primarily because of new palm oil plantations.
And when approached about this article, Febry Calvin Tetelepta from the presidential office told us palm oil plantations were a more efficient way to produce biofuel than using crops like sunflower and soy bean.
He said palm oil requires relatively smaller amounts of land for the same quantity of oil - which is correct.
There are more than 60 countries with a requirement for biodiesel in their fuel supply, but attitudes are changing in some of them.
Germany, the fourth largest global producer of biofuels, says that from 2023 it will no longer produce biodiesel from palm oil because of concerns about deforestation.
The EU has similarly tightened its restrictions.
Brazil  - another big user of biofuels - has reduced production this year because of successive droughts, which have lowered yields for soybean and corn.
Thailand has suspended indefinitely the rollout of diesel and biodiesel mixes because higher crop prices have made production unsustainable. 
Global Forest Watch says there are around 50 to 60 other, more environmentally friendly plants apart from palm oil, like candlenut and coconut, that could be used in Indonesia. 
However, research group Carbon Disclosure Project found that certification issues for biofuel production, alongside existing subsidies, encourages producers to continue with deforestation practices as opposed to seeking out sustainable alternatives.
Indonesia says it wants to move towards electric vehicles to cut transport emissions.
But it currently only has a modest plan for 2.2 million electric cars by 2030 and to sell only electric cars and motorcycles by 2050.
Indonesia has more than 21 million vehicles on the road, but only a few thousand were electric by the end of 2020.
And given that 90% of Indonesia's electricity is produced from fossil fuels (mostly coal), running an electric vehicle currently produces significantly more emissions than using diesel or petrol. 
Filda Yusgiantoro, director of an Indonesia energy think tank, says given the growing demand for vehicles, ""biofuels.. from palm oil will still play a major role in supplying fuel needs for the transportation sector"".

89,COP26,Kevin Keane,'Detail lacking' in Scotland's climate change plan,2021-12-07,"The credibility of Scotland's plan for tackling climate change this decade risks being undermined, an independent report warns. 
The Climate Change Committee (CCC) says the latest framework for reducing greenhouse gas emissions contains relatively little detail.
It calls for a clear breakdown of how annual targets will be achieved.
Ministers have pledged to reduce emissions to net zero by 2045 in a ""just and fair"" way.
The report assesses Scotland's climate change plan, which was updated in December last year, to take into account new legal targets to reduce emissions by 75% by 2030.  
It says the aim is laudable with a ""highly ambitious decade of decarbonisation ahead."" 
But it adds that the framework contains relatively little detail on how emissions with be reduced in practice and calls for a thorough and transparent quantitative breakdown.  
Targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Scotland have been missed for the last three years.
The report warns that credibility will be undermined if there is a widening of the gap between those targets and what is actually achieved.
Committee chairman Lord Deben said: ""Strategies alone won't reduce emissions. Major changes are needed across the Scottish economy, requiring lasting, systemic action in most sectors. 
""Clarity and transparency on policy, supported with detail on how these policies will be delivered has been lacking. My committee cannot assess future progress without this vital assurance.""
The report comes ahead of a debate at Holyrood on delivering a ""just transition"" to net zero, where our remaining emissions are offset.
Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: ""The CCC is not convinced by the current Scottish plans and calls for more work to show that we are on track to meet targets.  
""We would go further and say that the last climate plan needs to be urgently strengthened."" 
The report says ministers need to implement clear contingency plans for meeting the targets if technological fixes cannot be delivered.
Plans for a Scottish carbon capture and storage (CCS) cluster based around Peterhead and Grangemouth missed out on UK Government backing.
The project has instead been put on a reserve list for consideration.
CCS plays an important role in reducing net-emissions by storing it in depleted reservoirs under the North Sea.
Net Zero Secretary Michael Matheson said: ""The Scottish government is wholly committed to ending Scotland's contribution to climate change by 2045 at the latest, and ensuring we do this in a way that is just and fair for everyone.
""The independent expert advice of the Climate Change Committee plays an important role in shaping our ongoing response to the global climate emergency and I am grateful for its latest report, which we will carefully consider and respond to in full.""
Mr Matheson welcomed the report's recognition of the ""further advances"" in Scotland's climate policy ambition over the last year.
He added: ""I also agree entirely with the committee's key finding that the focus now, both for us in Scotland and for countries around the world, must be on the delivery of the policies to drive transformational emissions reductions across all areas of the economy.""
Mr Matheson pledged a combination of ""high ambition and action"" will ensure Scotland plays its part in delivering on the Glasgow Climate Pact, which was agreed last month at the COP26 summit.
The report also says plans to reduce emissions from heating buildings are ""very stretching"" and that there is an urgent need for a new low carbon agricultural policy with a move towards low carbon diets.

90,Climate change,BBC News,Climate change: Free tree offered to every Welsh household,2021-12-06,"Every household in Wales will be offered a free tree to plant in an effort to help tackle climate change. 
People will have a choice of native species to plant in their gardens or have added to woodland on their behalf.
About 1.3 million trees will be made available by the Welsh government, in a scheme which will cost Â£2m. 
Deputy climate change minister Lee Waters said the scheme could help, but there still needed to be a greater increase in planting trees.
""To meet our climate change targets, we have to plant 86 million trees by the end of this decade,"" he said. 
""That's an increase every year of 15-fold. So it's a hell of a challenge, as well as a climate emergency.""
Scientists have debated whether tree planting should be used as a way of combatting carbon emissions, but Mr Waters said there was an urgent need to try new initiatives and the benefits of tree planting go beyond capturing carbon. 
He said: ""We are in a climate emergency and that word emergency is really important. We can't wait for a perfect solution and we have got to try stuff and we've got to do it fast.
""We know trees help deal with flooding, they help your well-being, there's very good evidence that being around trees reduces your stress and your blood pressure. There's evidence to show that areas with lots of trees have a lower crime rate.""
Jerry Langford, of Coed Cadw - the Woodland Trust in Wales - said he was confident people would succeed in nurturing trees in their gardens. 
""Trees are tough actually,"" he said, ""you've got to treat them pretty badly to kill a tree. So just a bit of tender loving care, and it will be fine.
""They need a supply of water and they need to need to make sure they don't get swamped by competing vegetation.""
The trees will be available from five hubs from March, with a further 20 in the autumn of 2022. 
Coed Cadw will plant the trees which people opt not to have in their gardens.

91,Climate change,Rupert Wingfield-Hayes,Climate change: Is âblue hydrogenâ Japanâs answer to coal?,2021-12-06,"It's a glorious autumn afternoon and I'm standing on a hillside looking out over Tokyo Bay. Beside me is Takao Saiki, a usually mild-mannered gentleman in his 70s.
But today Saiki-San is angry.
""It's a total joke,"" he says, in perfect English. ""Just ridiculous!""
The cause of his distress is a giant construction site blocking our view across the bay - a 1.3-gigawatt coal-fired power station in the making.
""I don't understand why we still have to burn coal to generate electricity,"" says Saiki-San's friend, Rikuro Suzuki. ""This plant alone will emit more than seven million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year!""
Suzuki-San's point is a good one. Shouldn't Japan be cutting its coal consumption, not increasing it, at a time of great concern about coal's impact on the climate? 
So why the coal? The answer is the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.
In 2010 about one third of Japan's electricity came from nuclear power, and there were plans to build a lot more. But then the 2011 disaster hit, and all Japan's nuclear power plants were shut down. Ten years later most remain closed - and there is a lot of resistance to restarting them.
In their place Japan's gas-fired power stations have been doing a lot of overtime. But, as Britain has found out recently, natural gas is expensive.
So, the Japanese government decided to build 22 new coal-fired power stations, to run on cheap coal imported from Australia. Economically it made sense. Environmentally, not so much. Japan is now under intense pressure to stop using coal.
Instead of closing the old coal plants and switching to renewables, Japan's answer is to switch to burning hydrogen or ammonia. 
""The investment made by electric power companies in coal-fired power plants would suddenly be useless without value in their balance sheet,"" says Prof Tomas Kaberger, an expert on energy policy at Chalmers University in Sweden.
""And it would create financial difficulties for electric power companies and then for banks and pension funds. And that is the challenge for Japan.""
The plants can be quite easily converted to burning hydrogen or ammonia, neither of which produce any carbon dioxide. So this seems like a good solution. 
But Japan's government has much bigger ambitions than that. It wants to be the world's first ""hydrogen economy"".
This is where the carmaker Toyota comes in.   
It's another lovely sunny day and I'm in downtown Tokyo, at a shiny new hydrogen filling station. Standing on the forecourt is a sleek new Toyota Mirai. This is a big luxury car, about the size of a large Lexus.
I slip into the leather-clad cabin, press the ""start"" button and glide out on to the street. The car is extremely smooth, completely silent, and the only thing dribbling on to the road behind me is a bit of water. 
The Mirai (which means future in Japanese) is Toyota's first zero-emissions electric car. Unlike other electric cars, the Mirai doesn't have a huge battery under the floor. Instead, it has a fuel cell under the bonnet, and hydrogen tanks under the back seat. Hydrogen is combined with oxygen in a fuel cell to form water, with the reaction releasing energy as electricity, which runs the electric motors. It's the same technology that was used to power the Apollo spacecraft on the Moon missions.
To many people this technology is an odd choice. It's more expensive and complicated than batteries. Elon Musk has called hydrogen cars ""stupid"".
Not true, says Hisashi Nakai, the head of Toyota's public affairs division. He says the company's vision for fuel cells goes much further than just cars.
""I know people have different opinions,"" he tells me, ""but the important thing is realising carbon neutrality. We need to think about how we can make the most out of fuel cell technology. We strongly believe in hydrogen as a powerful and important energy.""
What Nakai-san says shows Toyota is thinking of a future where hydrogen fuel cells are everywhere, in homes and offices and factories, as well as cars. And it wants to be at the forefront of this new hydrogen society.
This brings us to the final, and most important question. Where is the hydrogen to power Japan zero carbon society going to come from?
The answer is ""blue hydrogen"".
Make hydrogen from water using renewable energy and you get ""green hydrogen"". The problem is green hydrogen is really expensive.
Instead, today most hydrogen is made from natural gas, or even coal. That is cheap but it produces lots of greenhouse gases. However, if you capture those greenhouse gases and bury them in the ground, you are allowed to call it ""blue hydrogen"".
This is exactly what Japan says it is going to do.
Earlier this year, Japan and Australia opened a joint project in the state of Victoria to turn a type of coal called lignite, or brown coal, into hydrogen. The hydrogen is then liquified to minus 253C, then piped into a specially built ship which carries it to Japan. 
What happens to the greenhouse gases produced at the site? Right now, they go straight up into the atmosphere.  But Japan and Australia are promising that, at some point in the future, they will begin capturing the greenhouse gas produced at the Latrobe Valley site and inject it into the sea floor off the coast.
Climate change campaigners are horrified by this plan. They say the technology to capture and store greenhouse gases is unproven and it will lock Japan into digging up vast quantities of brown coal for decades to come.
According to Prof Kaberger, the biggest hole in the plan is economic.
""Technically it's possible, but it will always be expensive,"" he says. ""Using fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage will always be more expensive than using fossil fuels alone, and now in many parts of the world renewable electricity is already cheaper than fossil fuels without carbon capture.""
Prof Kaberger thinks the Japanese government chose blue hydrogen a decade ago when renewables were expensive, and they are now locked into a plan that no longer makes sense.
""Japanese companies need cheap electricity to be competitive and they need clean electricity to be internationally acceptable,"" he says. ""That means they need renewable electricity. Delaying this development will harm the Japanese economy.""
In the meantime, on the edge of Tokyo Bay, construction continues apace. The giant new coal-fired power station will go online in 2023. It is expected to run for at least 40 years.
""I am ashamed of Japan,"" says Hikari Matsumoto, a 21-year-old activist who has joined us to look out from the hillside. 
""I'm so frustrated,"" she says. ""In other countries young people are out on the street protesting, but Japanese people are so quiet. Our generation needs to voice its opinion.""

92,COP26,Lola Mayor,I'm A Celebrity: 'Keep show in UK to help climate change',2021-12-05,"After being taken off air because of storms and intruders in the castle, I'm a Celebrity bosses could be forgiven for thinking ""UK, get me out of here!""
But makers of the hit reality TV show hosted by Ant and Dec have been urged to ""set an example"" and keep filming in Wales to help tackle climate change.
The Size of Wales charity said ITV's flagship show should no longer fly celebrities out to Australia.
ITV has not commented but pledged to have net zero carbon emissions by 2030.
""When you have companies like ITV and others that make commitments around net zero, often they'll build into their plans with stuff like carbon capture and offsets,"" said Kevin Rahman-Daultrey, of the Size of Wales climate change charity.
""But the best thing you can do is remove the footprint in the first place.
""It's not just about planting trees and trying to offset our emissions, we need to have companies like this making commitments to film more locally in the UK.""
I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! is normally filmed in the tropical Australian jungle, but for the last two series during the Covid pandemic it has based itself in chilly Gwrych Castle in north Wales.
""The show last year was very successful and they filmed it in Wales, so we don't need to necessarily go to Australia in order to have good content to watch,"" added Mr Rahman-Daultrey.
For 12 celebrities and I'm A Celebrity's famous hosts, first class flights down under from London produce more than 250 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, according to one carbon footprint calculator.
That's not taking into account production staff, family, internal flights or the impact of making the show itself.
The Size of Wales charity says, on average, one hour of British TV can create 10 tonnes of CO2 emissions to make, which is five times the average amount a single person emits in a whole year.
""We are talking significant contributions with just a single person flying from the UK to Australia and to make a show like this you're talking maybe 100 people going over,"" said Mr Rahman-Daultrey.
""And suddenly you start getting into quite significant levels of CO2 emissions.
""In order for us to meet the Paris Agreement targets and to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, we need to get people in the UK's carbon footprint a year down to about two tonnes.
""That's a single economy flight to Australia and you've used up your entire limit of carbon in a year if you're trying to be sustainable.
""So it is a very significant impact that this can have for what is essentially our entertainment.""
The Size of Wales charity's remit is to plants trees, support communities worldwide and help reduce deforestation and Mr Rahman-Daultrey said eliminating the need to travel as ""one of the largest contributions when it comes to the footprint"" would have a big impact.
I'm a Celebrity is currently enjoying its 21st series, although ITV had to take the unusual step of cancelling live shows last weekend after Storm Arwen caused ""significant damage"" to the set.
It meant contestants like football great David Ginola and broadcaster Louise Minchin had to be removed for safety reasons.
This video can not be played
ITV also had to remove intruders from the Grade I-listed 19th Century castle near Abergele while the celebrities were away hiding from the bad weather.
Mr Rahman-Daultrey feels the fact that I'm A Celebrity was taken off air because of a climate event is an ironic coincidence.
""The reality is that as we emit more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere we increase the risk of extreme weather and severe storms"", said Size of Wales' policy and educational manager 
""CO2 captures heat that fuels more powerful weather systems and the more we fly and emit the more we increase the risk of storms.
""While the UK will in no way be immune to this in future, the UK's weather will remain milder than many other places in the world. 
""We need to reduce our emissions from all sectors and entertainment is no exception.""
Dr Katharine Steentjes, from Cardiff University, has been looking at the psychology towards climate change and her research says people want ""urgent action"" by big businesses.
""What really came out in the research was that people really see it as a joint responsibility of all these big businesses and political leaders, as well as themselves,"" she said.
Ms Steentjes said she thinks a permanent move of the show to the UK by ITV ""would really resonate with people in the UK"" especially after the recent COP26 climate summit in Glasgow
She also thinks ""effective messaging"" and having a ""trusted source"" say how they plan to meet their targets with an example like this would really be welcomed by the by the UK public.

Seven blocks of woodland have been planted over the last two months by local volunteers and residents at Bradbury Lane, Hednesford.
About 1,000 more trees and shrubs will be added in the next few weeks, Cannock Chase District Council said.
They will contribute towards the local authority's aim of being net carbon neutral by 2030, it said
The plants soak up carbon dioxide, the most common greenhouse gas.
The work, with the help of Forest of Mercia CIC, has transformed a ""previously unremarkable"" common land, the council said.
Councillor Justin Johnson said since announcing the plan for the woodland in September there had been a ""great response"" from local groups.

94,COP26,Reality Check team,Climate change: Is the UK on track to meet its targets?,2021-12-03,"The UK has committed to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions to net zero by 2050. 
Net zero is the point at which the country is taking as much of these climate-changing gases out of the atmosphere as it is putting in.
As part of this promise, the government has a target to cut emissions by 78% by 2035, compared with 1990 levels. 
The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) - a group of experts that advises the government - says the net zero strategy is ""ambitious and comprehensive"" but that the UK government now needs to ""strengthen delivery"" and agree tougher policies.
Boris Johnson has set a target for all of the UK's electricity to come from clean sources by 2035.
Successive governments have been relatively successful in cutting emissions from energy - they fell by 40% between 1990 and 2019, with a big chunk of this coming from closing coal-fired power stations and spending money on solar, wind and nuclear energy. 
The CCC says the government still needs to publish a strategy for phasing out all gas-fired power stations by 2035, and work to remove fossil fuel subsidies.
The UK is a world leader in offshore wind. It has capacity of about 10GW, which the government has promised to quadruple by 2030. An increase to 40GW would generate enough energy to power every home in the UK.
The increase is achievable, but energy companies are worried the price they are paid for wind energy is dropping rapidly - this squeezes their revenues and could limit further investment.
There will also need to be much more energy storage for times when the wind does not blow. 
Housing accounts for about 14% of the UK's greenhouse-gas emissions, mostly because of gas-boiler heating systems and poor insulation, the CCC says.
The government has committed to installing 600,000 heat pumps a year by 2028. These transfer heat from the ground, air or water around a property into its heating system, and start at Â£6,000. 
About 35,000 were installed in the UK in 2019 - by comparison, about 1.7 million gas boilers are sold in the UK each year. There are 23.5 million gas boilers in the UK.
Grants of Â£5,000 will be available for homeowners to install a heat pump from April 2022. The government has allocated Â£450m for this over three years, which would be enough for 90,000 grants of Â£5,000 (if you ignore administration costs). 
Environmental groups have questioned how the government will meet its 600,000 target.
The net zero strategy only mentions insulation once, with support promised for low-income households. Earlier this year, the government scrapped its grant scheme to help people with the cost of insulating their homes.
The CCC points out that there is no mechanism to encourage or help pay for greater efficiency in the 60% of homes that are owner-occupied and not fuel poor.
Cars and taxis accounted for 16% of UK emissions in 2019 and, in a bid to cut this, the government says no new petrol and diesel cars will be sold from 2030. 
Electric-car sales are growing quickly - just over 10% of cars sold in 2020 were electric, up from 2.5% in 2018.
The government has not introduced a scrappage scheme to encourage people to buy electric vehicles, but a Â£2,500 grant is available for fully electric cars costing less than Â£35,000.
There has also been Â£20m allocated to testing and trials of zero-carbon HGVs
The move to electric will also require huge growth in publicly accessible charging points. 
Britain now has about 25,000 charging points but the Competition and Markets Authority says it could need 10 times as many before 2030.
To encourage people out of their cars, the government has promised to double cycling rates from 2013 levels by 2025 and build a ""world class"" cycling network by 2040. 
It has spent Â£338m on walking and cycling infrastructure in England, but while the pandemic increased cycling rates, it remains unclear whether the effect will be permanent. 
Before the pandemic, flying made up about 7% of overall emissions and shipping about 3%, but we do not know a great deal about how the government plans to reduce them and there are no specific targets for these sectors. 
The CCC says the government needs to freeze demand for flights and should publish a strategy to cut emissions from freight transport, aviation and shipping.
But the government says people can keep flying, and claims that technology yet to be developed should allow domestic flights to be almost emissions free by 2040, and international aviation to be near zero-carbon by mid-century.
In the Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak halved the taxes on domestic flights, which is expected to lead to an extra 400,000 passenger journeys a year.
He also increased the taxes on flights of more than 5,500 miles (8,851km).
The CCC says emissions from agriculture need to be cut by 30% between 2019 and 2035.
This would mean: 
The government has yet to publish the part of its food strategy that looks at the environmental impact of people's diets or a clear strategy for agriculture and land use across the UK. 
The CCC says current plans ""largely rely on the willingness of farmers and landowners to undertake measures"". It says there are signs consumers would be willing to change what they eat.
A new study by the National Food Strategy shows daily meat consumption in the UK has fallen by 17% in the last decade.
A government research paper recommending people shift towards a more plant-based diet was deleted shortly after its publication.
Trees have an important role in removing carbon emissions from the atmosphere. 
At the global climate summit COP26 in November, the government agreed to end deforestation in the UK by 2030, and it has an ambitious target to plant 30,000 hectares of trees a year by 2025 (a hectare is a bit bigger than a football pitch).
Annual tree planting was close to this figure back in the late 1980s (most of it in Scotland) but it has not risen above 15,000 hectares UK-wide since 2001. 
Tree-planting is a devolved issue, and Scotland has nearly twice as much coverage as England. 
Hydrogen is a low-carbon fuel that could be used for transport, heating, power generation or energy storage - and the government wants to have a capacity of 5GW of hydrogen production by 2030.  
But in an industry in its infancy - there is almost no low-carbon production of hydrogen in the UK or globally at the moment - this ambition is pretty hard to gauge.
The government admits it will need ""rapid and significant scale-up"" in the coming years.
And it is promising a decision on the role of hydrogen in heating by 2026.
The ability to capture carbon before it is released or take it out of the atmosphere and store it will be essential for the UK to reach net zero by 2050.
The government is aiming to capture and store between 20 and 30 million tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030. 
The technology is still emerging and is very expensive.
There are some projects planned, including one in north-east Scotland that can extract as much CO2 from the air as 40 million trees. 
Two areas have been chosen to have priority access to government funding for carbon capture projects - they are the Hynet Cluster covering the North West of England and north Wales, and the East Coast Cluster in the Humber and Teesside. North-east Scotland will be the reserve cluster.  
The government says it will cut emissions from manufacturing by about two-thirds from 2018 to 2035. 
Carbon capture and the switch to hydrogen will both play a big role but considerable progress is needed in these technologies. 
The government also plans to cap the amount of emissions allowed by individual sectors each year, which will reduce over time. 
But it is unclear how the scheme will safeguard against just shifting production and emissions to other countries. 
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

96,COP26,Roger Harrabin,COP26: UK 'nowhere near' meeting targets agreed at Glasgow climate summit,2021-12-02,"The UK is ""nowhere near"" meeting emissions targets enshrined at the Glasgow climate summit, official advisers have warned.
The Climate Change Committee (CCC) says that, at current rates, the UK will be contributing to a disastrous temperature rise of 2.7C by 2100.
It says this could - in theory - be brought down to just under 2C.
But this could only happen if ministers agree tougher policies, and if other nations slash emissions too.
The government insists that it will meet all its climate change targets.
Scientists say any temperature rise approaching 2C is extremely dangerous, so green groups want the UK to improve its emissions targets.
But the CCC says Britain will set a better example to the world if it keeps the same targets but actually delivers them through stronger policies.
It maintains that the government must nudge people towards greener lifestyles, and must tackle emissions from farming more aggressively.
The committee's chief executive, Chris Stark, said: ""The government is nowhere near achieving current targets.
""If it sets tougher targets that will simply widen the gap between ambition and delivery. What we really need is to strengthen delivery - and show the world that it can be done.""
His group has produced a shortlist of ideas to support Britain's climate leadership.
They include producing convincing plans to cut emissions by 78% by 2035; and drawing up agreements to radically reduce so-called ""embodied emissions"" from major polluters such as steel and cement.
The CCC also says the UK should act to reduce embodied emissions in imported goods - the emissions created to make the stuff British residents buy.
This could happen through taxes imposed on carbon-intensive goods being imported into the UK.
Another proposed strategy could be based on the final agreement at COP to phase out inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels. 
The committee says this gives the government licence to change tax policy so that fossil fuels pay for the damage they cause to the climate. It says the current tax system is currently clearly inefficient because it fails to bear down on polluting sectors that are damaging the climate.
This proposal could lead to increases in the cost of petrol, gas and aviation.
The government has been reviewing tax options, but it's been reported that senior ministers have warned against policies that could increase the cost of living for some. 
UK climate experts are worried about the Treasury's role in emissions policy. The Chancellor was widely blamed for failing to support the ill-fated Green Homes Grant. And, in his Budget just days before the COP, he omitted to mention climate change.
""The government is moving far too slowly,"" said Greenpeace director John Sauven.
""For the committee (CCC) to suggest it's OK for the UK to contribute to a temperature rise approaching 2C is outrageous. We know that a rise of 1.5C isn't safe - we're not even all safe now with a rise of 1.1C.
""What are we going to tell future generations about how we wrecked the climate?""
A government response to the CCC has been sought.

97,Climate change,Mark Savage,Why this wildlife expert is making his archive public,2021-12-02,"Recording animals in their natural habitat is not a job for those who lack patience.
Capturing just 20 seconds of a songbird's chirrup, or an elk's bugle, or a kangaroo's chortle often requires hours of stillness and solitude.
It's a craft that Birmingham-born sound recordist Martyn Stewart has perfected over the last 55 years. 
In that time, he's built up one of the largest private collections of natural sound in the world. Comprising 30,000 hours of material, it includes recordings of 3,500 bird species, alongside countless mammals, insects, amphibians and reptiles, as well as soundscapes of the Serengeti, the Arctic and Chernobyl, 10 years after the nuclear reactor meltdown.
At least four of the species he's recorded are now extinct in the wild, including the northern white rhinoceros and the Panamanian tree frog.
Sitting still and keeping quiet is all part of the job, he says, but it isn't simply a test of endurance. It can also put you in grave personal danger - as he discovered on a trip to the  Big Bend National Park in Texas.
""I was recording the morning soundscape when a mountain lion came up behind me and jumped at my head,"" he recalls. 
""It thought I was easy prey because I was silent. It dived at my body. I punched it in the face and it ran off.
""It was an incident of about 20 seconds but I had 125 stitches from my ear around the back of my head.""
Instead of reporting the incident to the park ranger he spun a story about falling down a steep bank and cutting his head open on a creosote bush.
""I didn't want to get the cat into trouble,"" he says.
When you spend time with Stewart, it's immediately apparent how deep his reverence for nature runs. 
He talks about the species he's met with quiet admiration, pausing often to explain that being amongst wildlife is his ""sanctuary"".
""The dawn chorus is incredible,"" he marvels. ""You have 50-plus species reading the news to each other. I interpret it as a conversation: 
   - 'Good morning.'
   - 'I've just arrived.'
   - 'Oh, where have you been?'
   - 'I was down in Argentina.'
   - 'What was the flight like?'
   - 'Good. Have you met Joe next door?'""
Stewart traces his passion back to childhood. Born and raised in Birmingham, in the West Midlands, he was lucky enough to live on a council estate directly opposite a greenbelt site ""that went on for miles and miles"".
""There was a little clump of woods about a mile from the house where you would find badgers, hedgehogs, hoverflies and all kinds of birds.
""I used to go there and lay on my back and listen to all the sounds... and it just enthralled me.""
As chance would have it, his elder brother was the singer in a band - so Stewart took his microphone, borrowed a reel-to-reel tape machine and made his first recording, of an Eurasian Blackbird.
""The blackbird was kind of like my friend,"" he says. ""When it made an alarm call, you knew somebody was entering the woods. So I got to know all the calls and the different vocalisations and what they meant. And I still have that recording now at the age of 66.""
Ever since, Stewart has been building an unparalleled collection of field recordings, visiting more than 55 countries and cataloguing 97,000 sounds. They've been used in natural history documentaries, as well as films and TV dramas. 
Others have served a more political purpose: he helped expose the illegal slaughter of seals on Namibia's Skeleton Coast, after setting out to record the breeding colonies of the Cape Coast. Ignoring signs that said ""trespassers will be shot"", he was arrested by police who confiscated his equipment - but not before he swapped out the memory cards for blanks.
""So if it's a toss up between animals frightening me and human beings, I think it's the latter,"" he says.
More than anything, however, Stewart is the David Attenborough of bird call. He has documented almost every species in his adopted home of North America - and is so attuned to their melodies that he can pick out where different birds of the same species come from.
""The Red-Winged Blackbird, for instance, has this 'conk-la-ree' sound but they all have different ways of talking. 
""It's like a Geordie talking to a Liverpudlian. Every state has a different accent - and yet the people in America all sound the same to me!""
Capturing these sounds is harder than you might think.
Over the years, Stewart has learned to eat a big breakfast in case the microphone catches his stomach rumbling; and he invests in industrial quantities of insect repellent, otherwise his recordings are spoiled by buzzing (and the occasional slap of palm against forearm - his love of nature doesn't extend to mosquitoes).
But the last decade has presented a bigger challenge - human interference.
""The environment we live in these days is incredibly noisy,"" he says. ""We have seven billion people on the planet making a lot of noise. Here where I live, in the United States, there's 20,000 planes in the sky at any given time. Then you have horns and ATVs, leaf blowers, cell phone interference.
""Twenty years ago, if I was to record one pristine hour of sound, it would take about three or four hours to capture that with just minimal editing.
""Today, to capture that one hour takes about 2,000 hours. Such is the noise that we live in.""
Stewart estimates that two-thirds of the environments he has recorded over the last half-a-century have now vanished forever.
""The roads that have gone through the Serengeti break the soundscape. A critical habitat has disappeared. Only 2% of old growth forests in the United States are left. And within those, you have forest dwellers like the spotted owl that are critically endangered. And so, so many more.""
That's one of the reasons Stewart has decided to open up his archives, making albums of habitats that are under threat, or lost. 
""You can't protect anything you don't understand, so I thought the best way to educate people about that was sound,"" he says.
Time is running out - in more ways than one. In December 2020, Stewart was diagnosed with bone cancer, and given three to five years to live. After further tests this year, the timeline was drastically shortened.
His niece, Amanda Hill, who worked on the BBC's Planet Earth, has been helping him prepare the recordings for release.
""I've found this project incredibly emotional,"" she says. ""Martyn and I have been close forever and I was always mesmerised by these remarkable adventures he's been on.
""He made the natural world come to life in a way that nobody had ever done for me, and his curiosity was intoxicating.
""So when we found out that Martyn was sickâ¦ there was a real need to have a conversation about what would happen with this remarkable legacy that he'd created.
""He always believed there was an intrinsic love for the world around you when you're young, but somehow as the world crowds in, nature gets crowded out. 
""And I think these sounds, for us, are a way of trying to share something beautiful and see if there's a way to inspire people to listen more intently and to connect more deeply.
""So yes, it's an incredibly emotional experience but the hope is that it inspires people to continue Martyn's work. We see it as a beginning.""
The result is Martyn Stewart's Listening Planet -  a non-profit foundation that aims to educate listeners and support conservation efforts, while releasing his recordings via Apple Music's Platoon Records label.
""You know I'm not a talented guy,"" he says with typical humility. ""The animals are the performers. I just sit there with a microphone and record them.""

98,Climate change,Simon King,2021 hurricane season was third most active,2021-12-01,"The 2021 Atlantic hurricane season has now officially ended, and it's been the third most active on record. 
Though the last month has seen little tropical storm activity, all the pre-determined names have been exhausted for the second year in a row.
There were 21 named tropical storms, including seven hurricanes, four of which were major hurricanes - where wind speeds were 111mph or greater. 
This puts 2021 behind 2020 and 2015 - the first and second most active years.
Matthew Rosencrans, lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (Noaa) Climate Prediction Center in the US, said: ""Climate factors, which include La Nina, above normal sea surface temperatures earlier in the season, and above average West African Monsoon rainfall were the primary contributors for this above average hurricane season.""
Hurricane Ida was the most powerful and costliest storm of the year in the region. It made landfall initially in the Cayman Islands on 26 August as a tropical storm. Then it intensified in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and became a powerful Category 4 major hurricane, with wind speeds of 150mph.
Ida eventually made landfall in Louisiana on 29 August, becoming the most destructive to hit the US state since Hurricane Katrina in 2015. As well as the damaging winds, Ida produced a lot of rainfall. Between 120 and 250mm fell in Louisiana, bringing widespread flash flooding.
While Ida weakened soon after landfall, it travelled north-east through the US and stayed as a potent weather system with heavy rain and floods. Newark, New Jersey, had its wettest day on record - 213mm, surpassing the previous record of 171mm.
Flash flood emergency warnings were issued in New York for the first time. These are only issued in exceedingly rare cases where there is a severe threat to human life with catastrophic damage.
Ida was estimated to have cost over $65bn in damage with 115 fatalities across the Caribbean Islands and the United States.
With all the tropical storm names being used up this year, the next named storm would have come from a new supplementary list of names and not the Greek alphabet, which would have been the convention until changes this year.
According to the World Meteorological Organization's hurricane committee, the use of the Greek alphabet in 2020 had shortcomings, including confusion with some of the names. 
Storms Zeta, Eta and Theta formed in quick succession, resulting in storms with similar-sounding names being active at the same time. According to the committee, this led to ""messaging challenges"".
While the 2021 season got off to a busy start, tropical storm and hurricane activity tailed off over the last few months
Tropical storm Wanda formed at the end of October, but before that, the last named storm was Victor, which formed and decayed in the open waters of the Atlantic at the end of September.
According to Philip Klotzbach, a hurricane specialist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, with no major hurricane forming throughout October it was the quietest period since 1977.
The rather abrupt end to tropical activity has been put down to a combination of a dry atmosphere around the tropics, greater atmospheric wind speeds, and the gradual lowering of sea surface temperatures as the northern hemisphere goes through autumn. All of these tend to make it less likely that major storms form.
While scientists expect climate change to make huge storms worse, the latest report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested with ""medium confidence"" that the global frequency of tropical cyclone formation will decrease or remain unchanged with increasing global warming.
With warmer oceans you get more fuel for a tropical storm or hurricane to develop and, according to the IPCC, ""it's likely that the frequency of rapid intensification in tropical cyclones has increased globally over the last 40 years"".
The report goes on to conclude with ""high confidence"" that the proportion of intense tropical cyclones will increase on the global scale with increasing warming.
In other words, the tropical cyclones that form are likely to become more intense which, if they hit land, will bring more impacts.

100,Climate change,BBC News,The Broads: 'Urgent action needed' over rising sea levels,2021-12-01,"Urgent action is needed to protect the The Broads from the effects of climate change, a group has said.
The Broads Society said a flood barrier was needed across the river at Great Yarmouth and suggested a network of Dutch-style drainage dykes.
It said the waterways, in Norfolk and Suffolk, needed protecting from the impact of rising sea levels.
The Environment Agency said a flood barrier was ""one approach"" that was being looked at.
Broads Society chairman Paul Rice said if action was not taken there would be ""a major problem"" in the next 10 years.
""We are expecting more floods over the Christmas period, we need to do something now, we can't wait,"" he said.
""If we don't do something now, we are going to lose a lot of things.""
The Broads Society, which was set up to secure the future of the Broads, declared a climate emergency for the river network at its recent annual general meeting.
Mr Rice said the current flood alleviation measures were ""not fit for purpose"".
James May, director of Maycraft, a family-run boatyard near Potter Heigham, said his business was ""flooded out every year"".
Mr May said a flood barrier would be welcomed.
""The Thames doesn't flood, Holland doesn't flood, they have a barrier. Why don't we have one? A barrier at Yarmouth would be a positive step, it would help no end,"" he said.
A spokesman for the Environment Agency said: ""In the Great Yarmouth area we have invested over Â£40m to upgrade the level of protection from tidal flooding to more than 4,500 homes and businesses since 2019.  
""A flood barrier at Great Yarmouth is just one approach that is being investigated by the Broadland Futures Initiative.""

101,Climate change,BBC News,Oxford's e-scooter trial extended until end of March,2021-12-01,"Oxford's e-scooter trial has been extended until the end of next March to further monitor their impact. 
Oxfordshire County Council's trial of Voi e-scooters had been due to end on Tuesday.
The authority said 118,000 trips had been made - replacing an estimated 40,000 car journeys - since they were introduced in February. 
Similar schemes have been launched in 15 other towns and cities in England, including Liverpool, Bath and Bristol. 
The council said the trial's extension would ""ensure that people who rely on e-scooters"" to travel around the city could still use them. 
Tim Bearder, the council's cabinet member for highways management, said: ""These e-scooters are a genuinely useful and low-carbon mode of transport to make short journeys.
""As a county council, we are committed to addressing climate change and transport innovation is a key part of that. 
""With the extension of the trial, many more residents can now benefit from a convenient, green, low-cost alternative to cars.""
The trial is being led by Swedish-based company Voi Technology. 
The e-scooters can only be used by adults, who use an app to unlock them. They cost Â£1 to unlock and 20p per minute to ride.

103,Climate change,athan Amos,Quest begins to drill Antarctica's oldest ice,2021-12-01,"Efforts are about to get under way to drill a core of ice in Antarctica that contains a record of Earth's climate stretching back 1.5 million years.
A European team will set up its equipment at one of the highest locations on the White Continent, for an operation likely to take four years.
The project aims to recover a near-3km-long cylinder of frozen material. 
Scientists hope this ice can help them explain why Earth's ice ages flipped in frequency in the deep past.
""Beyond EPICA"", as the project is known, is a follow-up to a similar venture at the turn of the millennium called simply EPICA (European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica). 
The new endeavour will base itself a short distance away from the original at Little Dome C, an area located roughly 40km from the Italian-French Concordia Station, on the east Antarctic plateau.
At an altitude of 3,233m above sea level and over 1,000km from the coast, Little Dome C will be an inhospitable place to work. Even in summer, temperatures won't get much above -35C. 
The camp where the drill team will base itself was set up in the 2019/20. This coming season will largely be about putting in the necessary drilling infrastructure. But the technicians do aim to at least start on their core quest by getting down beyond the first 100m.
This should take the borehole past the lightly compacted snow layers, or firn, into the impervious ice layers that are the real interest for scientists.
The deep ice in Antarctica contains tiny bubbles of air. These little gas pockets are a direct snapshot of the historic atmosphere.
Scientists can read off the levels of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping components, such as methane.
Analysing the atoms in the water-ice molecules encasing the gases also gives an indication of the temperature that persisted at the time of the snowfall that gave rise to the ice. 
When researchers drilled the original EPICA core, they uncovered a narrative of past climate temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide stretching back 800,000 years.
It's become one of the key climate data-sets of recent decades.
It showed that CO2 and temperature moved in lock-step. Whenever the Earth went into an ice age and temperature fell, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would also decline. And when the climate warmed back up again, the CO2 rose in parallel.
These cycles occurred roughly every 100,000 years - a phasing that is most likely linked to slight shifts in the eccentricity of Earth's orbit (a larger or smaller ellipse) around the Sun.
But it is recognised from an alternative record of past climate, which has been deciphered from ocean sediments, that deeper back in time the ice age cycle was much shorter - at about every 41,000 years.
That is a period probably dominated by the way the Earth tilts back and forth on its axis. But why the switch occurred, no-one is really sure. The new Beyond Epica core may contain some clues if its ices can extend the climate narrative back to 1.5 million years ago.
""We believe this ice core will give us information on the climate of the past and on the greenhouse gases that were in the atmosphere during the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), which happened between 900,000 and 1.2 million years ago,"" said team-leader Carlo Barbante, the director of the Institute of Polar Sciences of the National Research Council of Italy.
""During this transition, climate periodicity between ice ages changed from 41,000 to 100,000 years: the reason why this happened is the mystery we hope to solve.""
To achieve an 800,000-year record, the original EPICA project drilled to a depth of 2,774m. The bedrock at Little Dome C is just over 2,800m down. The extra 700,000 years being sought by the new project should be in the additional metres of layered ice. 
""We already have the 800,000 years of ice, so much of the first few years of drilling will simply be a repeat of ice we already have,"" explained Robert Mulvaney from the British Antarctic Survey.
""In practice, with many new PhD students coming online, and new groups getting involved, and new analytical techniques always being developed, we will make good use of the ice younger than 800,000 years.  
""We will also use the younger ice to ensure our techniques are working well by the time we get to the deep ice, where we only get one chance to get all the analyses right,"" he told BBC News.
Beyond EPICA is funded by the European Union. UK scientists are allowed to participate because the money comes from a period when Britain was still a part of the 27-member-state bloc.

104,Climate change,Helen Briggs,Wood Wide Web: Scientists to map hotspots of fungal life,2021-11-30,"A science mission is set to explore one of the final frontiers of untapped knowledge on the planet - the fungal networks in the soil beneath us.
Fungi form an underground network of connections with plant roots, helping to recycle nutrients and to lock up planet-warming CO2 in the soil.
But little is known about this giant mesh of fungi and its role in fighting climate change.
It is part of what's popularly known as the Wood Wide Web.
This is an underground network of plant roots and fungi that, among other things, allows trees to share nutrients.
And scientists say ""underground conservation"" has been long overlooked.
The initiative to map and preserve the Earth's underground fungal networks is led by the Society for the Protection of Underground Networks.
It is the start of an ""underground climate movement"" to protect ""this ancient life support system"" said Toby Kiers, professor of evolutionary biology at VU University in Amsterdam.
Local experts, dubbed ""myconauts"" after mycology, the study of fungi, will collect 10,000 samples over the next 18 months to compile a global map of fungal hotspots.
And machine learning will be used to build up a picture of the function of fungal networks and their role as carbon sinks - something that absorbs more carbon-containing compounds - such as carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - than it releases.
Scientists say fungal networks are under threat due to agricultural expansion, the use of fertilisers and pesticides, deforestation and urbanisation.
Current estimates put the amount of carbon dioxide taken out of the air and locked up in the soil with the help of fungal networks at five billion tonnes - although it could be more than three times higher.
""If we lose this system, this is going to have really serious consequences for our ability to fight climate change,"" Prof Kiers told BBC News.
Fungi are ""the invisible ecosystem engineers and their loss is totally undocumented"", she added.
Soils are home to 25% of all species on Earth, yet current plans to conserve biodiversity hotspots above ground fail to protect over 50% of biodiversity below ground.
The total length of the fungal network in the top 10cm of soil is more than 450 quadrillion kilometres: around half the width of our galaxy.

105,Climate change,Neil Prior,Advent calendars: Call to use non-plastic alternatives,2021-11-30,"As children prepare to open the first door of their advent calendars, one mother is urging Wales to consider the sheer scale of plastic waste.
Cathryn Scott was alarmed by the amount of single-use plastic her children received as gifts last year.
Advent calendars and selection boxes add to the three million tonnes of extra plastic waste created every year during the festive period in the UK.
Ms Scott wants us to ""give the planet a gift"" by considering alternatives.
It is estimated more than 16 million Advent calendars and about nine million selection boxes were sold in the UK in 2019 and almost every one contained some non-recyclable plastic.
""I've always felt uneasy about it,"" Ms Scott said.
""Each year we'd have around 10 identical selection boxes, but the true scale of the problem only really hit home when I saw [on social media] the plastic packaging from a selection box juxtaposed with the tiny amount of chocolate they actually contained.""
She added: ""I won't allow [Advent calendars] in the house. For 25 tiny chocolates there's a truly baffling amount of single-use plastic packaging.
""Don't get me wrong, I adore the thoughtfulness of everyone who's taken the time to buy my children a gift, but surely together we can be a little bit more imaginative?
""My three children [aged 12, 10 and seven] have a wooden Advent calendar which we refill each year. That way it can be a true novelty, as we can mix up the variety of gifts behind the doors, rather than the same old chocolate over again.""
Ms Scott, who writes an online blog, said the response from her readers had been positive: ""I was bracing myself for a backlash from people calling me Scrooge or Grinch, but if just a proportion of the people who say they agree actually take action this Christmas, we can make a real difference."" 
She has also urged larger chocolate companies to do better, with individual chocolate bars often costing less than the equivalent in a selection box.
However, she admitted smaller ethical companies were not always affordable for everyone and suggested making chocolate hampers from leftover cardboard, or reverse advent calendars, whereby children are encouraged to donate a gift, however small, each day during December.
""You should never underestimate how much pleasure kids get from giving as well as receiving, and if you can use it as an opportunity to teach them about world issues then so much the better,"" she said.
""If we can give the planet a present this Christmas, and at the same time try and get back to creating family experiences, then surely everyone's a winner.""
Mark Owen co-founded waste-free Pembrokeshire chocolatiers Wickedly Welsh with his wife Karen, and said making the correct ethical choices was not always as straightforward as it seemed.
""When we set up we'd intended to be 100% plastic-free. However, when we started looking more closely, we discovered that this might not actually be the most environmentally-friendly option,"" said Mr Owen.
""Much of the alternative starch-based plastic packaging uses more carbon to produce, and actually isn't as compostable as you'd think, unless sent to an industrial digester.""
So their firm has opted to use more rigid plastic packaging for advent calendars, which can be reused as moulds at home, or refilled.
""There are no easy decisions to be made on the environment, but luckily we have teenage kids who grill us more thoroughly on our ethical choices than any government could do,"" Mr Owen added.
Friends of the Earth Cymru campaign manager Bleddyn Blake said the ""only ethical choice"" was to consume less and buy from as local a source as possible.
However, Claire Lukins, who runs waste-free supermarket Plant to Plate in Caerphilly, said plastic was not the enemy, but rather ""the way we use it"".
She added: ""There's nothing wrong with plastic presents, as long as they're ones which will give your children years and years of enjoyment and not some piece of flimsy tat you'll be binning by February. That's a disaster.""

Earlier this month, she was jailed for four months for breaching an injunction and immediately decided to stop eating until the group's wishes are met.
The prison said it takes the health of prisoners ""very seriously"". 
Ms Smart is one of nine protesters who were jailed for breaching an injunction designed to stop road blockades, which caused disruption for motorists.

107,COP26,Elisabeth Mahy,"More work needed to create green jobs, report says",2021-11-29,"Efforts to create so-called green jobs need to intensify if the UK government is to achieve its target of two million roles by 2030, according to a report.
Jobs linked to the green economy accounted for 1.2% of all advertised roles in the year to July 2021, consultancy PwC said.
That equates to just 124,600 new jobs.
Boosting green job creation is part of the government's ""green industrial revolution"" plans.
In November 2020, the government announced Â£4bn would be spent as part of its plans to create two million green jobs by 2030. 
The COP 26 summit held in Glasgow a year later has put the issue into sharp focus again. 
But there are concerns that the green jobs transition could pose some risks, as it will have an impact on traditional jobs, especially in polluting industries.
In September, the Trade Union Congress (TUC) warned up to 660,000 jobs could be at risk if the UK fails to reach its net-zero target as quickly as other nations.
The simplest answer is a job that directly contributes to tackling climate change, although many think it should also cover roles that indirectly support that ambition.
Growing sectors where one might find more green jobs being advertised include low-carbon farming, heating without emissions, and wind turbine maintenance.
In its research, PwC said jobs that support the green economy indirectly should also be considered green. 
Such roles might include environmental advisers or experts in environmental or sustainability research and education.
PwC's report said work was needed to ensure the move to a net-zero economy does not add to regional inequalities.
It found that Wales, Northern Ireland and Yorkshire and the Humber lagged behind other parts of the UK in terms of transitioning to a greener economy. Scotland and London were the top performers, according to the research.
PwC ranked areas in terms of how they performed in job creation, the benefits of green jobs, the loss of ""sunset jobs"", the carbon intensity of employment, and green workplaces.
They hunted for online job ads that mentioned things like sustainability and environment - there had to be a number of mentions.
Kevin Ellis, PwC chairman and senior partner, said: ""Jobs are getting greener and this is cause for optimism, but evidence is needed on the level and distribution of these opportunities. 
""Left unchecked, green employment will grow in the most fertile spots, but not necessarily where they're needed most.  
""By acting now, we have a massive opportunity to rebalance the economy and ensure a fair transition.""
A government spokesman told the BBC: ""As this data shows, hundreds of thousands of green jobs are being created across the country, and our landmark Net Zero Strategy sets out how the UK will accelerate this growth, unlocking Â£90bn in private investment. 
""Our plans will see the majority of new green jobs to be created and supported outside London and the south east, with our shift to a low carbon economy providing an unprecedented opportunity to attract new, future-proof businesses in our industrial heartlands.""

The recommendation was from the Essex Climate Action Commission, which has advised Essex County Council on climate change.
The authority has agreed to several proposals from the commission to move Essex towards net zero by 2050.
Commission chairman, Jules Pretty, said: ""There are opportunities there to show sustainable investment policies.""
He said money from Essex County Council's pension scheme, one of the largest in local government, could be put into ""the green finance that was discussed at COP26"".
Conservative leader of the council, Kevin Bentley, said he wasÂ due to discuss the pension fund and would ""accelerate"" the work into investing it into sustainable firms.
""I couldn't agree more and I know my colleagues in the cabinet would agree with that too,"" he added.
According to the Local Democracy Report Service, the council's cabinet agreed to several recommendations from the commission including that solar panels be installed on every available roof on domestic, industrial and commercial buildings by 2050.
All domestic gas boilers should also be replaced by carbon neutral alternatives, such as heat pumps, by 2040.
The commission said by 2030 city centre and town car congestion should be reduced by introducing dedicated, well-planned cycling and walking routes across all urban and rural locations and to all railway stations, while upgrading and expanding the National Cycle Network.
It also said three new subsidy-free ""Park & Choose (pedal, scoot, stride)"" sites should be introduced by 2030.

Ministers had recognised the Isle of Man could be a ""key partner"" in the generation of renewable electricity, as it was ""sitting in the middle"" of all the administrations, ""surrounded by the sea"", Ms Poole-Wilson said.
There were discussions on how the island's own green energy capacity could be developed, after the Welsh delegation spoke about the research its government has done into tidal power, she added.
Ms Poole-Wilson said ""contracts for difference"", a mechanism used by the UK government to support low-carbon electricity generation, were identified as an issue that would need to be resolved so that the island ""could export into energy markets once its offshore wind capacity was up and running"". 
Returning from her first international conference since taking the role in October, Ms Poole-Wilson said there was ""real benefit in going physically to these summits"".
""We can learn from other administrations about how they are tackling problems, what solutions are available to them, and all of that is facilitated by the personal relationships built up between politicians"", she added.

110,Climate change,BBC News,Flood protection rules for new buildings delayed,2021-11-24,"Planning rules to protect new buildings from climate change-related flooding have been put on hold until June 2023, a week before they were meant to start.
Welsh ministers have delayed changes due to come into force on 1 December after complaints from some councils. 
In future, developers in Wales must consider the risk of floods and coastal erosion due to global warming.
Latest projections show a growing proportion of Wales is at risk of flooding from rivers and the sea.
In September, a set of maps was unveiled to show current risk levels, as well as the risk posed by climate change.
It was part of an update to a planning policy called Technical Advice Note (Tan) 15 that would help authorities decide whether to approve applications to build.
But, after some raised concerns, Climate Change Minister Julie James said she would suspend the new Tan 15 until 1 June 2023 ""to allow local planning authorities to fully consider the impact of the climate change projections"".
The maps show ""some significant increases in the extent of the highest risk flood zones including in some of our city and town centres"", she said.
The statement came on the day she launched a major consultation into adapting the planning system to limit the number of second homes and holiday lets.
They delay was welcomed by the Welsh Local Government Association, which said it ""granted more time to ensure Tan 15 is implemented and that it supports sustainable developments that grow our economy and create jobs"".
It said in a statement: ""This extra time will be used to ensure flood maps have been fully reviewed and the appropriate Tan wording agreed, and that these are supported by robust plans to address flood risk and protect our communities. 
""Councils will continue to carry out detailed flood consequence assessments over the next 12 months based on the new maps, and we look forward to working with the Welsh government to develop an agreed pipeline of flood mitigation measures.""

111,Climate change,Manish Pandey,"Climate change causing albatross divorce, says study",2021-11-24,"When relationships end it might be because the spark has disappeared, or maybe you just can't make time for one another.
But can climate change cause break-ups? 
It might do, according to a new study which suggests albatrosses - some of the world's most loyal creatures - are ""divorcing"" more.
Research published in the Royal Society journal looked at 15,500 breeding pairs in the Falkland Islands over 15 years.
Albatross divorce is basically just cheating, in human terms. It's when one part of a couple mates with a different individual.
Like humans, albatrosses also have an awkward growing-up phase, trying (and sometimes failing) to figure out the best way to get into a relationship.
But ultimately, when they find a good match, they normally stick together for life.
Just 1% of albatrosses separate after choosing their life partner - much lower than the human divorce rate in the UK.
""Monogamy and long-term bonds is very common for them,"" says Francesco Ventura, researcher at the University of Lisbon and co-author of the study.
But in the years covered by the study with warmer water temperatures, up to 8% of albatross couples split up.
The study says ""environmentally-driven divorce may be an overlooked consequence"" of climate change.
Normally, albatross divorce is triggered when a pair fail to breed, so they find new partners in the next breeding season.
But the findings showed pairs were divorcing even if they'd had a successful breeding season.
Francesco says there are two possible theories for the rise - the first one being linked to the struggles of a long-distance relationship. 
Warming waters force the birds to hunt for longer and fly further. 
If birds then fail to return in time for a breeding season, their partners may move on with a new partner. 
Another theory is albatross stress hormones go up in harsher environments, such as when waters are warmer. 
With tougher breeding conditions, and food scarcity, it can cause more stress and a partner can be blamed for their ""poor performance"" - which can ultimately trigger divorce, Francesco says.
The research comes as many international albatross populations are in trouble.
Some data from 2017 suggests the number of breeding pairs of the species are a little more than half of what they were in the 1980s.
Francesco says in the Falkland Islands, it's not an immediate concern for the population - but in other areas where the population of albatross is limited, it is a worry.
""Temperatures are going up and will go up, so this might introduce more disruptions,"" he says.

112,Climate change,Angus Crawford and Tony Smith,Polluting greenhouse gases being sold online and smuggled to UK,2021-11-23,"A BBC investigation has uncovered a black market in highly polluting greenhouse gases being smuggled into the UK from Eastern Europe.  
The gases - hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) - are advertised and sold illegally via social media and the BBC found a trader suggesting smuggling them on coaches.
HFCs are widely used in fridges, air conditioning and aerosol sprays.
The EU and UK are limiting their use and want to eventually phase them out in favour of cleaner alternatives.  
But older machinery still runs on the most polluting HFCs - which has led to a black market worth millions.
UK law states only registered companies can import, sell or use HFCs; and buyers must show an F-Gas (fluorinated gas) certificate, otherwise no sale would be allowed. 
The BBC's investigation began at the Romania-Ukraine border, where HFCs made in China have been smuggled through in the boots of cars or in lorries.
We found scores of online adverts posted by local traders offering the gases for sale and met one trader, called ""George"", who said he could get large quantities of HFCs.
After directing us to a quiet country road near the border crossing, he opened the boot of his car to reveal two canisters containing HFCs.
He offered them for roughly Â£100 each. They sell on the UK's illicit market for up to Â£240.
This video can not be played
To get the gases into the UK, he suggested smuggling them in the luggage compartments of passenger coaches that leave from the local bus station.
He said he previously sent 70 or 80 at a time to Germany using this method - it was just a question of finding the right driver and paying them.
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were developed as alternatives to ozone-depleting chemicals, which were banned under a global 1987 agreement known as the Montreal Protocol.
The deal banned the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were gradually replaced by HFCs.
HFCs are man-made, colourless and odourless.
They are mainly used in air conditioning, industrial chillers and fridges and can also be found in some aerosol propellants and fire protection fluids.
But they are powerful greenhouse gases, with some HFC blends thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Scientists previously discovered HFCs contribute to global warming by trapping heat radiating off the Earth.
The UK aims to reduce the use of HFCs by 69% by 2024.
Fin Walravens, a senior campaigner for the Environmental Investigation Agency, which investigates and campaigns against environmental crime, said the illegal HFCs trade was one most people knew nothing about - but the ""huge profits"" on offer made it ""very attractive"" to criminals.
Bottles made and filled with the gases for under Â£30 in China can sell in the UK for more than Â£200.
Ms Walravens urged customs and enforcement agencies to recognise that while HFCs might be invisible gases, they had ""a huge impact on global warming"".
Mihai Stoica, executive director of Romanian environmental campaign group 2Celsius, called for the authorities to work together to urgently stop the trade.
""I think this should have happened yesterday, we need to do as much as we can as quickly as possible.""
Despite the efforts of the authorities, the illegal HFC bottles are distributed across the EU and into the UK.
The BBC found them openly advertised for sale on Facebook marketplace across the country.
We contacted one seller in North London. He was not registered to handle the gases and offered them for sale in disposable canisters - which have been outlawed since 2006.
The illegal HFCs trade was estimated to make up between 20% and 30% of the whole European market, according to a July report by the EIA.
Rob Parker, European operations director for established supplier A-Gas, said the illegal HFCs trade was sometimes viewed as a ""victimless crime because it looks like nobody gets hurt"".
""But the profits from this will almost certainly be going back into organised crime where they'll be used for much darker activities,"" he added.
""Ultimately, more global warming can take place because the regulation hasn't been upheld.""
A spokeswoman for the UK's Environment Agency (EA) said: ""We are firmly committed to ensuring that businesses comply with regulations to reduce emissions from HFCs, and will take strict enforcement action where necessary.""
In September, the EA fined a company more than Â£1m for breaching F-gas regulations - exceeding the quotas of what it was allowed to put on the market.
It was only the second time the EA had ever imposed fines on a UK company for breaking the regulations.

It will be followed by refilling stations in Wellington and Taunton.
Reducing single-use plastic locally was key, councillor Dixie Darch, Liberal Democrat, climate change portfolio holder for Somerset West and Taunton council, said.
""Plastic can only be recycled so many times, and there's a carbon cost to that recycling - it takes energy - so any opportunity to reduce your single-use plastics is a big gain for the environment,"" she added.
Wellington High Street and Taunton High Street have had water refilling points installed and are undergoing water quality testing before they can be used by the public.

114,Climate change,glas Fraser,Will hydrogen energy help decarbonise the economy?,2021-11-23,"The use of hydrogen in transport hit a spectacular snag in May 1937, when the Hindenburg airship caught fire while trying to moor on a high mast in the wake of a New Jersey storm.
As the tragedy gained a lot of media attention, and as people realised that the gas filling those vast and glamorous trans-Atlantic craft was highly flammable, it brought a sudden end to the age of the airship.
But 84 years later, we've learned a bit about air safety, the impact of burning aviation fuel on the environment, and about hydrogen.
So it's back. And this most common of elements is being greeted (by some) as a magic bullet in the great energy transition.
It's very plentiful and recyclable, and the simple chemistry looks attractive. Split water into its two elemental components, with no emissions, then put the hydrogen into a fuel cell and hit the accelerator. Again, no harmful emissions. Only a return to water.
The catch is that electrolysis is expensive, and it is only now heading towards a commercial scale. The young company ITM, based in Sheffield, has taken over a former airfield to build a vast factory.  
One of its early orders is from Scottish Power, to install a 10 megawatt unit at the Whitelees wind farm on Eaglesham Moor.
That helps build supply ahead of demand - and in the hope of stimulating demand. At up to four tonnes of hydrogen per day, maximum production from phase one should be sufficient to get buses from Glasgow to Edinburgh, or the return journey, nearly 250 times. 
Phase two is expected to be the same scale, and to follow on quickly, at a lower unit cost.
Scottish Power, however, quietly admits it isn't all that interested in buses. It believes they would be better run on batteries.
It sees hydrogen as offering the fuel density and rapid refuelling that is important to shifting heavy loads, especially across long distances. Bin lorries in the city of Glasgow don't travel that far, but they require a lot of energy, they carry a lot of weight, and they are on course to be first customer for Whitelees' green hydrogen.
And this is where the question arises for hydrogen. In the words of Edwin Starr: what is it good for?
Heavy goods transport, almost certainly. Maybe shipping. In the coldest climates, where batteries fail. And perhaps fuel-hungry industries. 
Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, reckons that it could work for much of the 15% or so of the economy that is going to be particularly hard to de-carbonise.
So while ITM would like to see its electrolysis become part of the journey towards hydrogen cars, the utility boss is against that.
Cars have taken the battery route, and hauling them back to restart on a hydrogen future would expose some inefficiencies.
One catch is that the process is not as efficient as others. If you want to fuel a battery with renewable power, that's just what you do.
But with hydrogen, the wind turbine fuels the polymer membrane in ITM's electrolysis stack. 
The gas then has to be stored securely and transported to its point of use, at which point it powers a fuel cell, which then operates a battery-electric engine. Each link in that chain comes with a loss of energy.
So in answer to Edwin Starr, perhaps hydrogen is not as big an answer to oil and gas as some would like to think. Indeed, some have hopes that it could be the saving of oil and gas. For its critics, that would be a disaster.
Green activists are concerned that hydrogen is rarely green, through electrolysis, but mostly blue, derived from natural gas. That can be done much more cheaply, and the produce is used across industry, from refining to metals to food processing and NASA's rocket fuel.
Splitting the gas molecules produces carbon dioxide alongside the hydrogen. Among greenhouse gases, that is the prime suspect for climate change, so a climate-friendly solution has to be carbon capture and storage.
That, in turn, is a very expensive way of solving our climate problems. Indeed, it is proven in theory and in trials, but hasn't yet been proven at a commercial scale.
But it appeals to the hydrocarbon industry, as it allows for continued drilling for natural gas, and production of it, producing a fuel which has a lot more supporters than oil or gas currently do.
A further part of the hydrocarbon industry has its own special interest in adopting hydrogen. SGN, owner of the gas pipeline network, is looking into the 2030s and beyond, and wondering if its asset will be getting redundant.
It commissioned Wood, the former oil services group which now does consultancy work on other energy, to look into the Scottish prospects for heating homes through piped hydrogen.
Its report details initial conversion of Aberdeen home energy to reach 100% hydrogen by the end of this decade. At first, it would be 2%, rising as a mix to 20% - currently seen as the highest practical or safe level for a mix - and eventually 100%, making Aberdeen ""the world's first hydrogen-powered city"".
A lot of that would be blue hydrogen, through the Scottish cluster of businesses wanting to link its production to carbon capture and storage, with a major industrial site around the St Fergus gas terminal, north of the city. 
That is where natural gas has long made landfall, and from there, the pipelines stretch offshore with which to banish the treated carbon to subsea storage.
Its failure to win a UK government funding competition has left participants baffled and deeply frustrated.
Greg Hands, the Energy Minister, was at Whitelees wind farm this week, to confirm Â£9.4m support for the hydrogen project (just under half the total cost), and he told me the two Tier One projects, that did secure backing, were under way already, and that at least four such clusters were envisaged by 2030. 
""I don't want to prejudge where the second phase will go,"" he said,""but I think the Scottish cluster will be in a good position. It clearly passed the eligibility criteria, it did well on the evaluation criteria for the first tier, and has a good chance in the second tier.""
Under the SGN/Wood plan, the rest of Scotland's gas network could be converted to hydrogen only 15 years later than the Aberdeen target, in 2045. Wood throws in an extended pipeline network to gather in carbon dioxide from around the country for treatment and storage.
The total cost, at today's prices: Â£11.6bn. Of that more than Â£3.4bn is in continued and expanded blue hydrogen generation, and Â£2.6bn would be required for the green variety, most of that for electrolysis.
Some Â£1.1bn would prepare the SGN pipeline network for hydrogen, while Â£500m would buy a gathering network for carbon.
A further Â£3.3bn would pay for conversion of appliances in homes and business premises.
No-one said it was going to be cheap. But it could bring quality jobs and business opportunities. 
It's just one set of ideas, while the alternative - of doing nothing to decarbonise energy use across the economy - isn't a long-term, cheap solution either.

115,Climate change,BBC News,Australia declares La NiÃ±a phenomenon has begun,2021-11-23,"Australia has said a La NiÃ±a event has developed for a second consecutive year, meaning there is a greater risk locally of floods and cyclones.
Last time the weather phenomenon contributed to ""once in a century"" rains battering parts of Australia.
But La NiÃ±a can lead to significant weather changes in different parts of the world.
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is yet to declare a La NiÃ±a but has warned one may re-emerge. 
This year's event could be weaker, according to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (Bom).
""Climate models suggest this La NiÃ±a will be short-lived, persisting until the late southern hemisphere summer or early autumn 2022,"" it said on Tuesday.
La NiÃ±a is described as one of the three phases of the weather occurrence known as the El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This includes the warm phase called El NiÃ±o, the cooler La NiÃ±a and a neutral phase.
A La NiÃ±a develops when strong winds blow the warm surface waters of the Pacific away from South America and towards Indonesia. In their place, colder waters come up to the surface.
In Australia, La NiÃ±a increases the chance of cooler daytime temperatures - reducing the risk of heatwaves and bushfires.
But it tends to create wetter than normal conditions and can increase the frequency of tropical cyclones. 
Queensland has been warned of heavy rainfall and possible flash flooding this week. Last week, floods prompted evacuation warnings in Forbes, New South Wales.
Recent torrential rain in South Australia also led to the stranding of a young family in the outback.
During the last La NiÃ±a, thousands of Australians were displaced amid flooding which caused over A$1bn (Â£540,000m; $720,000m) in damage.
La NiÃ±a can increase the risk of storms in Canada and the northern US, often leading to snowy conditions. 
In the UK and Northern Europe, a very strong La NiÃ±a event may also lead to a very wet winter.

The WMO has said naturally occurring climate events like La NiÃ±a ""now take place in the context of human-induced climate change"", which is ""increasing global temperatures, exacerbating extreme weather and impacting seasonal rainfall patterns.""
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has already warned that a La NiÃ±a will extend through the northern hemisphere winter into early spring.

116,Climate change,Michael Race,New homes in England to have electric car chargers by law,2021-11-22,"New homes and buildings in England will be required by law to install electric vehicle charging points from next year, the prime minister has announced.
The government said the move will see up to 145,000 charging points installed across the country each year.
New-build supermarkets, workplaces and buildings undergoing major renovations will also come under the new law.
The move comes as the UK aims to switch to electric cars, with new petrol and diesel cars sales banned from 2030.
Announcing the new laws at the Confederation of British Industry's conference on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK was going to ""radically"" change its cars, trucks, buses and other modes of transport.
""The force driving that change won't be government, it won't even be business...it will be the consumer. It will be the young people of today, who can see the consequences of climate change and will be demanding better from us.""
But Labour said the announcement does not address the ""appalling"" geographical divide in available charging points.
""London and the South East have more public car charging points than the rest of England and Wales combined. Yet there is nothing here to help address this.
""Nor is there help so lower and middle income families can afford electric vehicles or the investment required to build the gigafactories we need,"" Labour said.
The government said the new laws will ""make it as easy as refuelling a petrol or diesel car today"".
It said ""simpler ways to pay"" to charge vehicles through contactless payments would also be introduced at ""all new fast and rapid charge points"".
Britain currently has about 25,000 charging points, but the Competition and Markets Authority has said it could need 10 times as many before 2030.
The switch to electric vehicles is part of the UK's strategy to hit climate targets, with cars and taxis accounting for 16% of UK emissions in 2019.
Several major car manufacturers, such as Jaguar and Volvo plan to go all electric from 2025 and 2030 and Ford has said all vehicles sold in Europe will be electric by 2030. 
However, four of the world's biggest carmakers, Volkswagen, Toyota, Renault-Nissan and Hyundai-Kia failed to sign a COP 26 summit pledge to only sell zero emissions cars and vans by 2035.
UK electric car sales are growing, with about 10% of cars sold in 2020 being electric, up from 2.5% in 2018.
However, concerns have been raised about the lack of charging infrastructure. The Policy Exchange think tank has warned the rollout of charging points has fallen behind and said there is a risk of ""charging blackspots"" in small towns and rural areas unless it speeds up.
MPs on the Transport Select Committee have also said people must be protected from excessive pricing for public electric car charging, with home charging being much cheaper.
Mike Childs, Friends of the Earth's head of policy, welcomed the government's announcement, adding that electric vehicles had a ""significant role to play in building a zero-carbon future"". 
""New housing should also include secure cycle storage and access to high quality public transport, to provide real alternatives to driving and help cut congestion,"" Mr Childs added.
Along with its announcement on charging points, the government also confirmed almost Â£10m will fund a new hydrogen project at the UK's largest onshore windfarm near Glasgow.
The cash injection will help the Whitelee green hydrogen project develop the UK's largest electrolyser, a system which converts water into hydrogen gas as a way to store energy and supply local transport providers with zero-carbon fuel.

117,Climate change,Zoya Mateen,Why schools are failing children on climate change,2021-11-22,"Every year, Shamayel Zaidi, a school teacher in India, gives his new senior school students the same assignment: a presentation on one of three topics - consumer awareness, social issues or environmental sustainability.  
Hardly anyone picks environment, he said. Not even in recent years since the perils of climate change have become more real everywhere - temperatures are higher than ever, glaciers are melting faster, violent cyclones and wildfires have become common, and children are at higher risk because of all of this. 
But in this residential school in the northern city of Varanasi, Mr Zaidi said, students are not interested because there has been no ""real effort"" to inform them of the severity of the climate crisis. 
""Unless it's your town that's being hit by a flood or some other catastrophe, people are not aware of how bad things are,"" he said. 
Inequality also plays a role, he added. ""Some of my students want to talk about climate change. But a lot of them come from families where such subjects are never discussed at home."" 
When 15-year-old Greta Thunberg started a school strike in Sweden in 2018 to draw attention to the climate crisis, she kicked off a youth-led movement that quickly gathered steam. For the the first time, children and teens - pouring out on to the streets in every continent - demanded climate action. 
Ever since, children have been taking centre stage in the fight against a rapidly warming world. And as they do, many are pushing for schools to add climate change to their curriculum. 
""Including climate topics in school curriculum is critical for training the next generation of innovative thinkers that can become champions of climate action at local and international stages,"" said Dr Ayyoob Sharifi, an associate professor at the Hiroshima University and one of the lead authors of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. 
New Zealand and Italy have already introduced climate change studies into the secondary school curriculum and Britain said at November's COP26 summit that a climate change teaching strategy was on the anvil. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently said there is a need to include ""climate change adaptation policies"" in the school syllabus. 
India currently has no curriculum on climate change, but some aspects such as sustainability are taught under environmental studies, which is compulsory in schools and colleges.
Dr Sharifi says teaching about climate change is of ""utmost importance"" for India as it is ""expected to experience rapid population growth and urbanisation in the coming decades"".  
If children are aware of the consequences of unsustainable growth, they are likely to adopt a more climate-friendly lifestyle, he said. 
Some schools in India have started doing this informally. At Shri Ram school in Gurgaon city, children learn to plant trees and make projects out of recycled products as they discuss changing weather patters and the social and economic aspects of their relationship with the environment.  
""It may not be a separate subject per se, but there is a curriculum in place to teach children about climate change and it's graded,"" said Sharda Sagar, who has taught environmental studies and social studies the school.
But experts say existing teaching methods do not address the scale of the problem. 
""The environmental curriculum focuses more on nature and outdoor education but doesn't touch upon how human actions contribute to climate change or how children can actually combat it,"" Keya Lamba said. 
Ms Lamba co-founded Earth Warriors - a climate change programme for children - with Shweta Bahri, an education policy expert. 
Earth Warriors offers a series of learning modules for children between three and seven years, introducing complex topics on climate change through animated characters, songs and simple activities. Lessons rely on reused and natural materials such as cardboard boxes, sticks and leaves. 
Ms Bahri says the idea is to teach children important concepts but to also make them ""feel like superheroes"" and make them realise that individual actions can help protect the planet. 
The course also trains teachers on how to approach the topic in ""a non-scary positive way"". 
The curriculum has been piloted in about four countries, including the UK, US and Botswana, and will be launched in a few private primary schools in India in February. ""This is a start but our end goal is to make this a national curriculum in India and elsewhere,"" Ms Lamba said.
But not everyone agrees that Indian schools need a separate curriculum on climate change. 
Anita Rampal, former dean of the Faculty of Education at Delhi University, says that instead of relegating the topic to a separate textbook, there is a need to integrate it with existing subjects ""so that it runs through the entire curriculum"". 
""Climate change and related topics such as the biodiversity crisis and ecological justice are very important to understand, but they are also abstract and challenging,"" she said. ""It's not enough to preach moral messages or give definitions. These concepts and issues need to be woven into whatever you teach.""
There are other challenges too. Huge disparities exist between underfunded government-run schools and plush private ones, making it that much harder to integrate climate education across the board. 
""It's easy to say schools should create outdoor time and practical activities, but the truth is that it cannot happen in many poor schools in India. So, more than a curriculum, schools need to be supported to be able to bridge this gap,"" Ms Sagar said. 
But teachers also worry about the despair and hopelessness students can feel upon learning about the troubling reality of climate change.
Ms Rampal says that's a part of growing up. ""Children have to address issues as they face them. A curriculum is never just transmitting information, it is about a child constructing her own knowledge.""
Other experts say solutions too must be an integral part of learning about climate change. 
""Only showing a dark image of the future will certainly have a negative mental impact,"" Mr Sharifi said. ""Schools need to emphasise that there are solutions to the problem and that our individual and collective actions can make a big difference.""

118,Climate change,BBC News,Insulate Britain: Police arrest 124 after Lambeth Bridge protest,2021-11-21,"Police have arrested a total of 124 activists after a central London bridge was closed by a sit-down protest.
The Lambeth Bridge demonstration was held in support of nine Insulate Britain campaigners jailed for defying an injunction on road blockades.
Up to 250 people took part in the sit-in on Saturday, shutting the bridge for hours.
Insulate Britain said it was not involved in organising the demonstration.
Police made the arrests after imposing Public Order Act conditions.
The majority of people detained have since been released under investigation.
The Met Police said the bridge was reopened at about 19:00 GMT, with the final protesters removed from Vauxhall Cross a few minutes later.
The forced said on Sunday: ""We thank members of the public for their patience while officers worked to remove the groups.""
Campaigners told the crowd that the nine jailed Insulate Britain campaigners were ""political prisoners"" who will not be the last to be locked up for their convictions about climate change.
The nine protesters were given sentences of three to four months for breaching an injunction, aimed at preventing the blockades which have brought several roads to a standstill and sparked anger among motorists.
Activists on the bridge said they would not be deterred by the threat of prison.
Insulate Britain said it had not organised the protest, which participants said was ""community-led"".
But the group has said it intends to continue to protest until the government agrees to ensure homes are insulated by 2030 - a key factor in reducing the UK's energy use and carbon emissions.
The High Court has issued five injunctions so far to prevent road blockades, covering the M25, as well as other major roads around London and the port of Dover.

The Lambeth Bridge demonstration was held in support of nine Insulate Britain campaigners who were jailed this week for defying an injunction on road blockades.
Up to 250 people took part in the sit-in, shutting the bridge for hours.
Police made the arrests after imposing Public Order Act conditions on the protest.
The Metropolitan Police said the bridge was reopened at about 19:00 GMT, with the final protesters removed from Vauxhall Cross a few minutes later.
Earlier, uniformed officers stood on Lambeth Bridge while traffic was diverted, with police saying it was ""for the safety of all"".
Meanwhile, demonstrators made speeches, sang songs, ate lunch and chanted slogans.
Campaigners told the crowd that the nine jailed Insulate Britain campaigners were ""political prisoners"" who will not be the last to be locked up for their convictions about climate change.
The nine protesters were given sentences of three to four months for breaching an injunction, aimed at preventing the blockades which have brought several roads to a standstill and sparked anger among motorists.
Activists on the bridge said they would not be deterred by the threat of prison.
Gabriella Ditton, 27, an animator from Norwich, told the PA news agency she has already been arrested six times with Insulate Britain.
""I expect to go to prison at some point for at least six months because I am not going to be apologetic about this,"" she said.
She said ""civil resistance"" was necessary to create the political will to solve the climate crisis.
Zoe Cohen, 51, who travelled from Warrington, Cheshire, to protest, said ""ordinary people should not have to do this and risk prison"".
She said the disruption caused by the protests was ""microscopic"" compared to the death and suffering caused by climate change.
Gully Bujak, a campaigner linked with Extinction Rebellion, said to police at the protest: ""These streets are ours and we will put one foot in front of the other, and dare you to stop us.""
She added: ""You can jail the resister but not the resistance.""
Another told the crowd, to cheers, that ""good people have a duty to disobey bad laws"".
Insulate Britain said it was not involved in organising the demonstration, which participants said was ""community-led"".

120,Climate change,BBC News,More than a thousand trees to be planted in north Northamptonshire,2021-11-20,"More than 1,000 trees are due to be planted across North Northamptonshire after the local council secured a grant to fund their purchase and upkeep.
The money from the Local Authority Treescape Fund will be paid between financial years 2021/22 and 2024/25.
In all, North Northamptonshire Council has been awarded Â£237,504.
The authority's executive member for climate, Harriet Pentland, said the move would reduce carbon emissions.
The grant covers the purchase of 1,040 trees and associated stakes and cages. It will also pay for three years of aftercare.
The aim is to establish trees in non-woodland settings such as in riverbanks, hedgerows, parklands, urban areas, roadsides and footpaths.
Sites in Corby, Kettering, Broughton, Rothwell and Raunds have already been identified as suitable for tree-planting.
Conservative leader of the council Jason Smithers said: ""Since we declared a climate and environment emergency in July, we have been working tirelessly to ensure we are doing all we can while also looking to the future.""
Ms Pentland said planting trees also had ""biodiversity benefits, including the creation of new habitats and flood risk alleviation"".

121,Climate change,BBC News,British Columbia: Petrol rations after Canada storm,2021-11-20,"A Canadian province is rationing petrol over fuel shortage fears after a major storm cut off road and rail links.
Canadian Armed Forces personnel have begun arriving in British Columbia to help with recovery efforts in the flood-stricken region. 
On Friday the province issued travel restrictions and rations on petrol, just a few days after declaring a state of emergency.
At least one person has been confirmed dead, but more deaths are expected.
British Columbia Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth said non-essential traffic would be restricted while they rebuild the highway network. Fearing a fuel shortage, he called on people only to fill their vehicles with 30 litres per trip to the petrol station until 1 December. 
He did not say how close the province was to running out of gas, and said he would not send police to enforce the ration.
""It's 10 to 11 days where we have to pull together as a province, if we're greedy, we'll fail,"" he told media on Friday.
""The overwhelming majority of people will do the right thing,"" he added.
With major highways shut and the Canadian Pacific rail line facing multiple track outages, the federal government is looking into alternatives to help supplies flow into the affected area. 
US border officials have allowed truckers who don't usually cross the border to access roads so they can deliver supplies, the province says. 
As of Friday, approximately 14,000 residents were still displaced from their homes. A major agricultural region, almost 1,000 farms are under an evacuation order and thousands of farm animals have already been trapped and killed by the floods.
More than 100 soldiers have been deployed to the area so far and more stand by. Helicopters stationed on Vancouver Island and other's parts of British Columbia might also be called on to ferry supplies and emergency personnel or evacuate residents. 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has pledged to ""to do more to help people directly."" 
Plans to build a 2.5 km levee were scrapped in favour of building a dike. Heavy rains are expected to sweep through the area next week.
Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Abbotsford mayor Henry Braun said that water levels are still rising in several areas near the town.
""We are not out of this thing by a long shot,"" Mr Braun said.
He estimated that repairing Abbotsford after the storm may cost up to C$1bn ($790m, Â£590m).

122,Climate change,BBC News,In pictures: British Columbia devastated by catastrophic floods,2021-11-19,"Canada's west coast is reeling from catastrophic flooding after a major storm destroyed roads, houses and bridges in what may be the costliest natural disaster in the country's history.
A state of emergency has been declared in British Columbia (BC) - Canada's western-most province - in the wake of the storm. 
As of Thursday night, approximately 17,000 residents were still displaced from their homes, with nearly 10,000 properties facing evacuation orders or alerts.
Local officials have warned that the price tag to rebuild could exceed C$1bn ($790m, Â£590m).
Authorities have confirmed that one woman was killed in a landslide, and two people are missing. Officials expect more fatalities to be confirmed in the coming days.
One man caught up in the storm told the BBC the scenes afterwards were like ""Armageddon"".
Thousands of farm animals died in the flooding and more may have to be euthanised. 
The flooding has caused highways to close and cut off rail access to Canada's biggest port. The shut-downs are adding to existing supply chain disruptions. The province's premier has urged people not to hoard supplies. 
The devastating storm follows massive wildfires in the province this summer, which tore through British Columbia's interior region and razed one small town, Lytton, to the ground.

123,Climate change,BBC News,Brazil: Amazon sees worst deforestation levels in 15 years,2021-11-19,"Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest has hit its highest level in over 15 years, official data shows. 
A report by Brazil's space research agency (Inpe) found that deforestation increased by 22% in a year. 
Brazil was among a number of nations who promised to end and reverse deforestation by 2030 during the COP26 climate summit. 
The Amazon is home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people. 
It is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. 
According to the latest data, some 13,235 sq km (5110 sq miles) was lost during the 2020-21 period, the highest amount since 2006. 
Environment Minister Joaquim Leite said the data represents a ""challenge"" and said: ""We have to be more forceful in relation to these crimes."" 
He added that the data ""does not exactly reflect the situation in the last few months"".  
Deforestation of the Amazon has increased under President Jair Bolsonaro. who has encouraged agriculture and mining activities in the rainforest. 
He has also clashed with Inpe in the past over its deforestation, accusing the agency in 2019 of smearing Brazil's reputation. 
But at November's climate conference in Glasgow, Brazil was among a number of nations who signed a major deal to end and reverse the practice. 
The pledge included almost Â£14bn ($19.2bn) of public and private funds. Some of that will go to developing countries to restore damaged land, tackle wildfires and support indigenous communities. 
Close links have previously been uncovered between the deforestation of the Amazon and international supply chains. 
Last year, a Greenpeace investigation discovered links between the mass deforestation of the region and food sold in British supermarkets and restaurants. 
The investigation found that Tesco, Asda, Lidl, Nando's and McDonalds were selling meat, sourced from a UK supplier, which had been fed on soy grown on farms built in deforested areas. 
Just this week, Jair Bolsonaro, on tour in Dubai, told investors that attacks towards Brazil on deforestation were ""unfair"".
""We want people to know the real Brazil,"" he said, adding that 90% of the forest is still preserved.
Well, these latest figures reveal the real Brazil - a country whose government has from the very beginning talked up the opportunities in developing the Amazon and at the same time, belittled environmental concerns.
Not only that, these figures were actually dated 27 October - it appears they were held until after COP26.
Jair Bolsonaro didn't turn up to COP26, but his delegation wanted to go to Glasgow and convince the world that people were wrong about Brazil - it even said it would move forward its commitment to ending deforestation by 2028.
But with numbers like these, who can believe Jair Bolsonaro now?

124,Climate change,Marco Silva,Climate change: Conspiracy theories found on foreign-language Wikipedia,2021-11-19,"Several foreign-language Wikipedia pages seen by BBC News are promoting conspiracy theories and making misleading claims about climate change.
A number, including some in Swahili, Kazakh and Belarusian, suggest scientists are divided over its causes.
The overwhelming scientific consensus is global warming is caused by humans.
A representative of the Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, said they were ""worried"" by the findings and more volunteer editors were needed.
The ""climate change"" entry on Chinese Wikipedia lists solar activity as one of the possible explanations for rising temperatures around the world today.
Other widely disproven theories listed include unfounded claims about the emergence of a totalitarian world government and tie calls for climate action to secretive financial interests.
On Croatian Wikipedia, more than a third of the page on global warming is devoted to questioning the science of climate change, while also pushing conspiratorial views.
""This worries me a lot,"" Wikimedia Foundation senior programme strategist Alex Stinson said. ""And this is why we need more people involved in this project.""
Wikipedia is published in more than 300 different languages, each with its own original content and volunteer editors. 
Open for anyone with an internet connection to edit, the quality of its content is entirely dependent on those volunteers.
More volunteers in different languages would decrease the chances of conspiracy theories and bad information lingering on the site, Mr Stinson said. 
Yumiko Sato, a Japanese writer based in the US who has investigated misinformation on the platform, said: ""Wikipedia only works if the editing community is large and diverse."" 
Launched in 2001, the online encyclopaedia is one of the world's most visited websites.
The English-language version, the largest, has more than 40,000 users actively editing it each month. 
Its climate-change pages have a group of dedicated volunteer editors who actively patrol for any sign of bad information or pseudoscience.
But the same does not apply to many of the pages in languages other than English.
In more than 150 languages, fewer than 10 people a month regularly edit any pages.
""[These versions] are much smaller and lack editorial diversity, so that makes them vulnerable to manipulation,"" Ms Sato said.
One of Wikipedia's core principles is self-governance.
So, unless the community of editors steps in, the Wikimedia Foundation can do little.
""The foundation has never intervened on editorial policies directly and that is not what we do,"" Mr Stinson said. 
""We need to push back on this disinformation in science - but that only works if the science-literate show up in that language, in that context, and that Wikipedia [version].""

125,Climate change,BBC News,Vancouver storm: A state of emergency has been declared in British Columbia,2021-11-19,"A state of emergency has been declared in the Canadian western province of British Columbia after a major storm cut road and rail links in the region. 
The Canadian Armed Forces have been deployed to help thousands of stranded residents who have been trapped since the storm hit overnight on Sunday. 
Local officials warned on Thursday that the price tag to rebuild could exceed C$1bn ($790m, Â£590m).
One woman was killed in a landslide, and two people are missing. 
Officials expect more fatalities to be confirmed in the coming days. 
One man caught up in the storm told the BBC the scenes afterwards were like ""Armageddon"".
Thousands of farm animals have died and many more remain trapped by the flood waters after the storm passed through one of Canada's most agriculturally intensive areas.
Some 18,000 people are yet to return to their homes after an ""atmospheric river"" - a long strip of moisture in the air that transports water from tropical areas towards the poles - dumped the region's monthly rainfall average in 24 hours. 
As of Thursday, nearly 7,000 properties remained under mandatory evacuation orders, with more than 2,500 others under evacuation advisory.
British Columbia Premier John Horgan announced the two-week emergency order on Wednesday, in order to keep people off flooded roads and expedite rescues.
Helicopters on Wednesday dropped food supplies to stranded mountain communities after slides destroyed roads and floods submerged major highways. 
Approximately 1,500 travellers became stranded in the town of Hope after roads closed, Grace Baptist Church Pastor Jeff Kuhn told BBC News in an email on Wednesday. Officials said about 1,000 people were able to leave the town on Thursday.
Some highways have reopened, including Highway 7, connecting Hope to Vancouver. 
Store shelves have also seen their inventories running low, and officials have advised residents to conserve fuel.

Peter Rzazewski lives in Burnaby, British Columbia, with his wife, Karina, and two dogs. But the couple has been stuck in the rural town of Hope since Sunday after visiting family in Lake Country. 
They slept in their car Sunday and Monday nights before spending Tuesday night in the basement of a church and Wednesday night in a home offered to them through the church. 
""When we got to Hope, it was the strangest thing because there were no lights on, all the power was out. We parked at a gas station under the canopy by one of the pumps and stayed the night,"" Mr Rzazewski told the BBC.
""It was like Armageddon. There were lots of cars, lots of people sleeping in cars.""
Mr Rzazewski hopes that Highway 7 will stay open long enough to allow them to get home. 
Officials in the region have attributed the natural disaster to the effects of climate change.
Mr Horgan said British Columbia must ""bring the seven billion other souls that live on this planet to understand that we need to act now"" to prevent these events in future.
The impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but we know that increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons. As a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall. 
The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.
University of British Columbia atmospheric scientist Rachel White told the BBC that the massive devastation caused by this storm can likely be attributed to a combination of human-caused factors. 
""As we warm up the climate, heavy rainfall events such as these are going to get more intense,"" she said.
""As we warm up the atmosphere, as we warm up the oceans - more water is evaporated from the oceans. So then when we have these atmospheric river events, essentially the atmosphere can carry more water towards our mountains."" This then condenses into rain. 
The extreme weather in Canada comes days after world leaders met for the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow. 
The same region, British Columbia, suffered a record high heat wave in the summer that killed more than 500 people as well as wildfires, including one that destroyed the village of Lytton.

Newcastle retains its 'A'-grade status, while Sunderland gains its first, from international climate research provider CDP.
Newcastle has pledged to reach net zero by 2030, with the entire city carbon neutral.
Sunderland is aiming to become carbon neutral by 2040. They are among 95 cities worldwide recognised.
The target includes making more vehicles in Newcastle electric, cutting home energy usage and recycling more.
Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes told the Local Democracy Reporting Service the city was ""incredibly proud"" to have retained its top grade status.
He said: ""Tackling the climate emergency remains the great challenge of our age and this very much reassures us that we are on the right track.""Â 
He added that momentum from the COP26 climate conference held in Glasgow should be harnessed and further steps taken to ""create the clean, green and inclusive communities we all want to live in"".
Among Sunderland's green initiatives are working with Nissan to create an Electrical Vehicle Hub, a waste recycling scheme at the port which will reduce plastic waste, and commitment to include young poeple in the city's climate action plans.
Sunderland City Council leader Councillor Graeme Miller said: ""We must act like our lives depend on it...because they do. 
""We are seeing increased flooding, extreme weather - from record heatwaves to devastating storms - and yet collectively we do little to address it. But if we are to make a global impact, then we must start in our own communities.""
A CDP spokesperson said: ""The cities on this year's A List, are also celebrated for showing that urgent and impactful climate action - from ambitious emissions reduction targets to building resilience against climate change - is achievable at a global level, and in cities with different climate realities and priorities.
""However, this action needs to go further and faster to meet the new targets agreed at COP26.""

The Totem Latamat was carved by Jun Tiburcio in ChumatlÃ¡n, Veracruz, from a single tree.
It has travelled throughout Britain - including a visit to Glasgow during COP26 - to highlight the climate change concerns of indigenous peoples.
It will now be ""returned to the Earth"" in a ceremony on the Crichton estate in Dumfries at the weekend.
The piece was commissioned by the Border Crossings' ORIGINS Festival - celebrating indigenous art - as a response to climate change.
It was carved by Totonac artist Mr Tiburcio before being brought to the UK.
The totem has been described as a ""message from the Totanac people to our communities and world leaders"".
It aims to highlight how ""deeply interwoven our existence is with nature"" alongside the ""need for immediate action to disrupt the damage done by climate change"".
""It has visited locations and communities as diverse as London's Chiswick House, Station Square in Milton Keynes, Hexham Abbey, Manchester University and the megalithic Rollright stone circle in Oxfordshire,"" said Border Crossings' artistic director Michael Walling.
""Everywhere it has been, Totem Latamat has been welcomed with songs and ceremonies, movingly showing the spirit of global solidarity between our own communities and the indigenous people who stand on the front line of climate change. 
""Jun Tiburcio's own house was largely destroyed by Hurricane Grace during the period of the project: a direct result of the global temperature rise.""
Now that it has delivered its message, it will be ""returned to the Earth"" on Saturday - and allowed to naturally decompose - in Dumfries and Galloway.
Ahead of that, there will be a discussion of its journey available online and in-person at the Crichton site on Friday evening.
""Unlike Western materialist cultures, which seek to preserve their artworks as a way to attract monetary value, indigenous cultures regard their artefacts as beings with life, and therefore perishable,"" explained Mr Walling.
""That is why Totem Latamat, having done what it needed to, will this weekend be returned to the Earth with gratitude.
""Because it is made of natural materials, its decay will enrich the planet.
""The Crichton Estate in Dumfries is the perfect place for this to happen - a focus for education and community with a history of healing and a strong ecological agenda, it offers the totem a fitting final place of rest.""

129,COP26,David Shukman,'I've seen irreversible change but hope too for planet',2021-11-18,"As he leaves the BBC after decades of reporting, the BBC's science editor David Shukman reflects on how climate change became our most pressing problem - and how he's witnessed the natural world itself drastically altering.
His face was flushed and his voice was loud. You're making it all up about global warming, a man shouted as he approached me. We were in the Royal Society, the UK's leading scientific academy, and a panel discussion about climate change had just finished. It's nothing to do with carbon dioxide, he bellowed, before security guards led him away.
Climate change has aroused passionate debate because it raises questions about our lifestyles and modern economies. And in the early days of my reporting, the picture was not as clear as now. The basic physics had long been understood: that adding certain types of gases to the air will trap more heat.
But nearly 20 years ago, the United Nations climate science panel was still cautious, saying it was ""likely"" not ""certain"" that human activity was driving up temperatures.
Researchers were gathering more evidence all the time and I witnessed much of their work: in a crevasse in Antarctica where bubbles of air, trapped in the luminous blue ice, held clues about the ancient atmosphere; watching an Oxford professor kneeling in the Kalahari desert to count grains of sand to calculate how far the dunes might spread with global warming; and riding an armoured vehicle through Siberia to research how the permafrost is melting.
And this fieldwork, combined with data from satellites and results from models run on supercomputers, led to a landmark conclusion recently: that it's now 'unequivocal' that it's us heating up the planet.
At the same time, the implications of a more hostile climate were becoming clearer. A rise in the global temperature of up to 2C used to be thought of as ""safe"". And on my first trip to the Greenland ice sheet, in 2004, researchers were talking of the melting ice as more of a problem for the future. That was soon to change.
We now know that a rise of just over one degree is proving dangerous. And returning to the same spot in Greenland 15 years later was a shock. Where towering cliffs of ice once stood there was now bare rock. The remaining ice seemed diminished. In the mild temperatures I felt uncomfortably hot while meltwater was pouring into the ocean, raising its level.
And this creates a profound unfairness about climate change. While a city like London can defend itself with the gleaming steel of the Thames Barrier, many communities around the world are unprotected.
In Gabura, on the coast of Bangladesh, a feeble embankment was breached by a storm and, when we visited back in 2009, the village was being flooded every high tide. We waded into the water to film a large and desperate crowd using mud to try to hold back the sea. 
There was no other option. You might think international aid would have made a difference over the past decade or so. It hasn't. Seawater is still poisoning the wells and the fields. There are sandbags on the embankments now but they're no guarantee as the level of the sea keeps climbing, as distant Greenland loses its ice.
Like all developing countries, Bangladesh was told 12 years ago that by now there'd be a steady flow of a guaranteed amount of finance from the richest nations. It's a promise that's remained unfulfilled. And this was a major source of contention at the COP26 climate conference.
There is a pattern at many of these annual events - and I've now been to 10 of them.

Global leaders make emotional speeches about saving the planet but then leave their negotiators to protect national interests by haggling aggressively over each line. In Glasgow, the trickiest tussle was over coal, with India and China demanding that the words ""phasing out"" were altered to ""phasing down"".
The COP26 president Alok Sharma had to hold back tears. The pressures of corralling nearly 200 countries are intense. At a conference in Bali, the chair actually broke down. And at another gathering, in Copenhagen, many African delegates walked out in protest. Meanwhile the gases raising temperatures have been steadily increasing.
Yet there are some positive signs. When I first watched a windfarm being built, it was a slow process and very expensive, and the idea of planting turbines out at sea seemed outlandish. Now both wind and solar power are far cheaper and are therefore more plausible and attractive to investors. So are batteries. The giant car makers are having to go electric.
Most countries - and many companies - have committed to being carbon neutral by the middle of the century. Some are more sincere about this than others. But greater scrutiny and more public awareness mean there's less room to dodge and hide. It's becoming harder to greenwash. And the annual conferences, for all their watering-down of final conclusions, do provide momentum and a sense of direction.
So along with feeling despair at the damage that extreme weather is causing to the most vulnerable people, I'm also inspired by a new level of engagement, a surge of clever innovations and a younger generation mobilised and determined to find a way through.
Humans can be staggeringly short sighted but also ingenious when faced with real trouble. At the very least, there's always another conference.

132,Climate change,BBC News,What's holding up Scotland's bottle deposit scheme?,2021-11-17,"Scotland's bottle return scheme seems likely to suffer further days, with the Scottish government blaming Covid-19, Brexit and a row over tax rules.
The scheme will add 20p to the price of products sold in some plastic drinking containers, cans and glass with the money being refunded when the containers are returned.
The government originally outlined its plans in 2017, saying it represented ""a step change in our level of ambition"" for recycling
Ministers had originally hoped the scheme would start in April 2021, but this was pushed back to July 2022, with the government blaming the pandemic.
It is now widely expected to be delayed again after Circular Economy Minister Lorna Slater told MSPs that a number of other issues were holding up the system, including Brexit.
She also claimed there had been a ""lack of clarity"" from the UK government over the tax status of the 20p deposits.
Ms Slater insisted that the government remains fully committed to implementing the scheme - but would not give a timescale for when it would actually happen.
Environmental group Greenpeace has been critical of the government, saying that a further delay would mean ""millions more cans and bottles needlessly dumped and burned"".
And opposition parties have said it as an example of the government's environmental rhetoric not being matched by its actions.
The scheme will apply to all types of drinks in containers between 50ml and three litres in size.
Glass containers have been included in the scheme, despite some criticism from the glass industry.
The Scottish government has said that HDPE-made plastic bottles, which are typically used to carry milk, will not be included.
However, containers made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) - which typically carry fizzy drinks and water - will be subject to the deposit return.
Effectively, 20p - the deposit - will be added to the price of a single-use drinks container bought from a shop. 
The consumer will get their deposit back when they return the empty bottle or can to the retailer.
The scheme will operate throughout Scotland, including rural areas and all retail outlets will have to comply, regardless of size.
Businesses selling drinks which are opened and consumed on site - such as pubs and restaurants - will not have to charge the deposit to the public.
There will be two ways you can return your empty container - over the counter, or by using a reverse vending machine (RVM). 
An RVM is a machine that scans containers when they are returned and then refunds your deposit.  
The government says there will be a range of ways you can get your 20p back, for example cash at a till, a token or discount voucher or digitally. The returned containers are stored in the machine and are then collected for recycling.
As well as retailers and hospitality businesses, schools and other community hubs will be able to act as return locations.
The government says an independent, privately-run, not-for-profit company will be in charge. 
It adds that the system will be paid for through three sources of funding - unredeemed deposits, revenue from the sale of materials and a producer fee. 
Scotland could still be the first nation in the UK to introduce a bottle deposit return scheme as recycling is a devolved issue.
A consultation on the introduction of a similar scheme in England, Wales and Northern Ireland was carried out by the UK government last year.
A four-week pilot for a deposit return scheme was recently run in Conwy in north Wales.

133,COP26,Shruti Menon,Climate change: What emission cuts has India promised?,2021-11-17,"India is the third largest emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2) after China and the US.
With its rapidly growing population and an economy heavily dependent on coal and oil, its emissions are on a steep upward trajectory unless action is taken to curb them. 
Along with China, India forced a last minute change to the agreement at the COP26 climate summit, softening a commitment to tackling emissions from the burning of coal.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set his country a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2070, a significantly later deadline than many other countries.
India has resisted setting overall reduction targets, saying industrialised nations should bear a much greater share of the burden as they have contributed far more towards global warming over time. 
It says an ""emissions intensity"" target, which measures emissions per unit of economic growth, is a fairer way to compare it with other countries, it says.  
By 2030 Mr Modi says India will reduce the emissions intensity of its economy by 45% (that's of all greenhouse gases not just CO2) - a more ambitious target than the previous goal of a 33-35% cut in its emissions intensity from the 2005 level by 2030.
But a fall in carbon emissions intensity does not necessarily mean a reduction in overall emissions.
Climate Action Tracker (CAT), which monitors government policies and actions, says the target is unlikely to have an impact on limiting overall projected emissions.
The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says a target of global net zero - where a country is not adding to the overall amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - by 2050 is the minimum needed to keep the temperature rise to 1.5C.
And more than 140 countries have publicly promised to meet this.
India's prime minister has pledged that it will increase its non-fossil fuel energy capacity to 500 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. 
It currently has a capacity of around 157GW.
India had previously set itself a target of reaching 175GW by next year.  This goal excluded large hydroelectric and nuclear capacities, which it looks likely to miss as it currently stands at just over 100GW.
Although the new target for 2030 is more ambitious, it will only have a ""small impact on real-world emissions,"" says Climate Action Tracker.
Also in 2015, India promised to provide 40% of all electric power from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.  Mr Modi has now increased this figure to 50%.
Generation capacity from these sources stands at around 39% as of September this year, according to India's official statistics.
But the actual amount generated in 2020 was lower at around 20%, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
Cindy Baxter, of CAT, says developing countries such as India, need international support to decarbonise their economies and limit the temperature increase to 1.5C in line with the Paris Agreement. 
""India does not have a conditional target that identifies where...or indeed how much support it needs.""

India has also abstained from signing a global deal made at COP26 to reduce emissions of methane gas.
It's one of the most potent greenhouse gases, created by agriculture, fossil fuels and waste, and India is a major emitter.
India has highlighted many times it wants to bring a third of its land area under forest cover, which can help absorb carbon. 
But it has not given a timescale for this - and progress has been patchy.
Although there have been replanting initiatives in the southern parts of India, the north-eastern region has lost forest cover recently.
And India plans to plant enough trees by 2030 to absorb an additional 2.5-3 billion tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere.
Global Forest Watch - a collaboration between the University of Maryland, Google, the United States Geological Survey and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) - estimates India lost 18% of its primary forests and 5% of its tree cover between 2001 and 2020. 
But the Indian government's own survey data indicates a 5.2% increase in forest cover between 2001 and 2019.
The GFW report includes only vegetation taller than 5m (16ft) whereas India's official figures are based on tree density in a given area of land.

The Cop26 global summit, in Glasgow, in November, is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions - and it could lead to major changes to everyday lives.

134,COP26,BBC News,What is Insulate Britain and what does it want?,2021-11-17,"Nine Insulate Britain protesters have been jailed for illegally blocking traffic on the M25. 
The campaign group began a wave of protests two months ago, blocking major roads and motorways in England.
Insulate Britain is a recently-launched campaigning organisation. 
It is calling for a national programme to ensure homes are insulated to be low energy by 2030.
The group has blocked a number of major roads in and around London, including around Parliament.
Insulate Britain has also targeted the M25 near the Dartford Crossing, the Old Street junction, and the Blackwall Tunnel - where there were angry exchanges with drivers.

The government has taken out a number of court injunctions to try to prevent further action, and new powers targeting such protests have been announced.
These include four injunctions granted to National Highways, banning demonstrations on the M25, around the Port of Dover and on major roads around London, and one to Transport for London (TfL).
TfL was granted a civil banning order aimed at preventing protesters from blocking traffic on some of London's busiest roads.
UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that every motorway and major A-road in the country is now covered by injunctions, tweeting that ""Anyone who causes misery to motorists may face prison.""
Nine Insulate Britain protesters were jailed for breaching the ban on protests on the M25 by taking part in a blockade of the motorway on 8 October.
Eight were sentenced to four months in prison. 
Another protestor, Ben Taylor, was given a longer sentence of six months, ""to deter [him] from committing further breaches,"" after Judge Dame Victoria Sharp criticised his submissions to the court as ""inflammatory"" and a ""call to arms"". 
The group had suspended its civil resistance campaign ahead of the recent COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow.
But speaking outside the Royal Courts of Justice after the sentencing, the group's representatives vowed to keep protesting.
Insulate Britain lists two main aims on its website:
Low energy homes use considerably less energy and use renewable energy for heating and electricity.
In June, the UK Committee on Climate Change said there had been ""minimal progress"" in recent years on improving the insulation of buildings or in switching to low-carbon heating.
Many of those directly affected by protests have objected to the group's tactics.
Boris Johnson labelled Insulate Britain ""irresponsible crusties"" who have been ""doing considerable damage to the economy"".
Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer said while there was a place for direct action, Insulate Britain was ""not necessarily always doing it in the most constructive way"".
Insulate Britain defends its tactics, saying they are the most successful route to achieve mass change.
Insulate Britain is a much smaller UK-specific campaign group, although they share many goals and have used similar tactics. 
It is supported by some members of Extinction Rebellion and its allied networks - although the groups are not officially integrated.

135,Climate change,BBC News,Climate change: Aberdeen Harbour and BP in bid to reduce emissions,2021-11-17,"Aberdeen Harbour and BP are to work together in a bid to identify ways to decarbonise port operations.
The harbour board and the energy giant are aiming to develop plans that could reduce emissions from vessels using the port.
Potential projects include exploring using hydrogen as a clean marine fuel.
Last month, the city council confirmed BP as its preferred bidder for a commercial partnership to help Aberdeen become a leading hydrogen hub.
Under the new memorandum of understanding, the harbour and BP will also explore the potential for a pilot project to supply shore power.
This would allow vessels to turn off their main engines while in port to reduce emissions and noise.
It comes as a Â£350m harbour expansion project continues.
The work to make a new deeper and larger harbour is the largest marine infrastructure project in the UK.
It will be able to provide space for cruise ships and renewable energy projects.
Aberdeen Harbour Board chief executive Bob Sanguinetti said the collaboration with BP came at a ""significant time"".
He said: ""Reducing emissions from vessels berthed in the port and providing low carbon power supplies will be critical to achieving a green maritime industry and requires innovative thinking and practices.""
BP North Sea senior vice president Emeka Emembolu said: ""For nearly 30 years, Aberdeen Harbour has provided BP with world-class facilities in support of our North Sea oil and gas operations.""
He added that BP was ""delighted"" to be strengthening the relationship. 
Earlier this month, BP announced bumper profits after oil and gas prices soared amid a global economic bounce back.
However, the long-term outlook for fossil fuel demand remains uncertain.
Last week, a new global agreement to limit climate change - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit.
BP has previously said it plans to sharply reduce its carbon emissions in the coming decades by increasing its renewable power capacity 20-fold by 2030, while reducing its oil output by 40% and diverting more funds to low-carbon investments.
However, it is still investing billions in oil, focusing on oil fields where it can make higher profits.

136,COP26,Jasmine Ketibuah-Foley,COP26 plan leaves young people feeling 'betrayed',2021-11-17,"Young people have said they feel ""betrayed"" by the COP26 plan to phase down rather than phase out coal.
Students from Bristol and Bath said the resolution's lack of urgency was ""frightening and upsetting"".
A recent study has shown immediate government inaction on climate issues is ""inextricably linked"" to ""eco anxiety"" in people under the age of 25.
A Bath University researcher said the plan would exacerbate young people's anxieties about the environment.  
Environmental psychologist Professor Lorraine Whitmarsh said their sense of betrayal was ""understandable"".
If global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, scientists say the earth is likely to experience severe effects such as millions more people being exposed to extreme heat.
As a result, COP26 delegates at the summit in Glasgow agreed to reduce coal use.
But the decision was met with disappointment by other delegates and pressure groups who fear it doesn't go far enough to sustain a 1.5C temperature rise by 2030.
Bath University student Maria Cundale, 22, said: ""The way our leaders are not dealing with the issue right now is really frightening and upsetting.
""As an individual you feel like you're doing your best to make things work but when it's not immediately happening on a global scale you feel really insignificant.""
She said world leaders making decisions like these intensify feelings of eco anxiety and make its effects ""even more damaging"".
University of the West of England student Lizzie Coney, 24, helped to make a COP26 video sharing young people's climate fears and hopes.
She said every young person around the world is feeling the same anxiety and ""the COP26 decision has made it worse"".
""It makes me angry. It was a grand opportunity that was completely missed,"" she said.
In response to the agreement, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was ""still a huge amount more to do"". 
""Critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a roadmap to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees,"" he said.
Prof Whitmarsh said: ""The Glasgow Pact is not a game-changer, but it has made important steps forward.
But she said young people, especially those from developing countries, ""understandably feel betrayed"".

137,COP26,Roger Harrabin,Climate change: What did the scientists make of COP26?,2021-11-17,"Scientists and leading climate experts have voiced concerns about the outcomes of the COP26 climate conference, in Glasgow.
Those who spoke to the BBC praised the conference for getting countries to agree to meet again next year to pledge deeper emissions cuts. And they welcomed agreements on forests, innovation and especially methane - from fossil fuel extraction and livestock. 
But the scientists fear politicians wonât deliver. And they say the hope of holding temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels is far too unambitious anyway.
The experts say that with a temperature rise so far of just 1.1C, the world is already in a state of dangerous heating, with record temperatures, wildfires, floods and droughts.
Prof Sir David King, former UK chief scientist,told me: âOf course heating is already at a dangerous level. Greenland is sitting in blue sea for three months losing ice. Temperatures in the polar summer were 32C â¦ the forests were on fire.
âEven if we cut emissions completely weâd still be in a difficult place because of the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere already.â
There's a similar message from Prof Piers Forster, coordinating lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. âPeople are already dying and species are becoming extinct with current temperatures,"" he said. ""We have locked in centuries of sea level rise. 
â1.5C has become the talisman for the safest we can hope for this century. But the more we learn the more we realise there is no safe limit [for emissions].â 
The scientists we contacted appreciated that COP offered practical solutions. 
Thereâs relief that after 22 previous COPs, there is at last reference to the need to phase down fossil fuels - although thereâs dismay that India and China watered down the wording at the last minute. And there are widespread fears that politicians wonât keep their promises.
Prof Gail Whiteman, founder of Arctic Basecamp, said the summit had produced ""mixed results"". She said: ""There's a lot of pretty good pledges on the table - but is there going to be enough action? I don't know. I'm worried.""
And Prof Tim Lenton, from Exeter's Global Systems Institute, added: âOn the plus side, the coalition of civil society, business, finance, NGOs and others around COP26 is starting to drive real progress.
âBut we are still heading for more than 2Â°C of global warming, which risks triggering multiple climate tipping points [when natural systems collapse because of increased temperatures]. We are still in a climate crisis.""
""We all need to persuade our political leaders to join us in the great transformation,"" he added. ""The international policy process is moving slower than the climate system.â
Itâs that gap - between policy, action and science - that so alarms climate experts.
The UK, for instance, is acknowledged to be a global leader in policy, setting out domestic targets to achieve near zero emissions by 2050. 
But the government has consistently failed to reach its previous climate change targets. While itâs lauded for policies such as phasing out conventional cars, itâs failing on home insulation.
It wants to increase flying against the advice of its advisors and it is permitting an oil field near Shetland. It is building more roads and the carbon-heavy HS2. 
To the astonishment of the scientists, Chancellor Rishi Sunak didnât mention climate change in his budget on the eve of COP26.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, meanwhile, continues to insist that carbon cuts can be made by technology alone, with little or no change in behaviour - even though the advisory Climate Change Committee insists that targets for 2030 canât be hit without a combination of both.
There are similar policy tangles in the US. President Joe Biden is struggling to get his green measures through Congress, and his $1tr infrastructure programme for roads, bridges, airports and ports will produce many millions of tonnes of emissions from the concrete and steel used to make them - as well as the traffic that will be generated by them.
President Biden may have led the pact to cut methane emissions - but he wonât match Mr Johnsonâs pledge on cars. And Americans are still buying huge SUVs.
The US climate envoy John Kerry estimates that if nations really apply themselves, temperature rises could be held to 1.8C. The scientists say that's too little, too late. 
Prof Richard Betts, of the Met Office Hadley Centre, told me: âWe could still avoid further increases in the impacts of climate change with greater ambition. 
âBut until we completely stop building up carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, we will still continue the heating of the climate and causing evermore severe risks and impacts.â
Ed Hawkins,professor of climate science at the University of Reading,warned: âThere is a slope, which we are already sliding down. The sooner we stop sliding - through deep, sustained and immediate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions - the less severe the consequences will be.â
An even more profound challenge comes from Julian Allwood, professor of engineering and the environment at the University of Cambridge. He told me the solutions being discussed in Glasgow depend on unrealistic amounts of clean electricity, carbon capture and biomass. 
âIf you compare the amount with whatâs available today and any plausible growth rate, thereâs no possibility we will have enough of those,â he said.
âWe therefore need a different sets of policies such as using half the amount of electricity. We must cut levels of flying, shipping, cement and ruminants because thereâs no way of dealing with themâ.
This is an unpalatable message for politicians who want to achieve a stable climate by tweaking Business As Usual.

138,Climate change,Rachel Schraer & Kayleen Devlin,COP26: The truth behind the new climate change denial,2021-11-17,"As world leaders met at the COP26 summit to debate how to tackle climate change, misleading claims and falsehoods about the climate spiralled on social media. 
Scientists say climate change denial is now more likely to focus on the causes and effects of warming, or how to tackle it, than to outright deny it exists. 
The 'd-words' v the planet
We've looked at some of the most viral claims of the past year, and what the evidence really says. 
People have long claimed, incorrectly, that the past century's temperature changes are just part of the Earth's natural cycle, rather than the result of human behaviour. 
In recent months, we've seen a new version of this argument. 
Thousands of posts on social media, reaching hundreds of thousands of people over the past year, claim a ""Grand Solar Minimum"" will lead to a natural fall in temperatures, without human intervention.
But this is not what the evidence shows. 
A grand solar minimum is a real phenomenon when the Sun gives off less energy as part of its natural cycle. 
Studies suggest the Sun may well go through a weaker phase sometime this century, but that this would lead, at most, to a temporary 0.1 - 0.2C cooling of the planet. 
That's not nearly enough to offset human activity, which has already warmed the planet by about 1.2C over the past 200 years and will continue to rise, possibly topping 2.4C by the end of the century. 
We know recent temperature rises weren't caused by the changes in the Sun's natural cycle because the layer of atmosphere nearest the earth is warming, while the layer of atmosphere closest to the Sun - the stratosphere - is cooling. 
Heat which would normally be released into the stratosphere is being trapped by greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide from people burning fuel.
If temperature changes on Earth were being caused by the Sun, we would expect the whole atmosphere to warm (or cool) at the same time.
Various posts circulating online claim global warming will make parts of the earth more habitable, and that cold kills more people than heat does.
These arguments often cherry-pick favourable facts while ignoring any that contradict them. 
For example, it's true that some inhospitably cold parts of the world could become easier to live in for a time. 
But in these same places warming could also lead to extreme rainfall, affecting living conditions and the ability to grow crops, 
At the same time, other parts of the world would become uninhabitable as a result of temperature increases and rising sea levels, like the world's lowest-lying country, the Maldives. 
We face climate extinction, at-risk nations say
There may be fewer cold-related deaths. According to a study published in the Lancet, between 2000 and 2019, more people died as a result of cold weather than hot. 
However, a rise in heat-related deaths is expected to cancel out any lives saved. 
The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says overall, ""climate-related risks to health [and] livelihoods...are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5 degrees"". Any small local benefits from fewer cold days are expected to be outweighed by the risks of more frequent spells of extreme heat.
A common claim made by those against efforts to tackle climate change is that fossil fuels have been essential to driving economic growth.
So limiting their use, the argument goes, will inevitably stunt this growth and increase the cost of living, hurting the poorest.
But this isn't the whole picture. 
Fossil fuels have powered vehicles, factories and technology, allowing humans over the past century to make things at a scale and speed which would previously have been impossible. This enabled people to make, sell and buy more things, and become richer.
But stopping using coal doesn't mean returning to the days of ox-drawn carts and hand-cranked machines - we now have other technologies that can do a similar job. 
In many places, renewable electricity - powered by wind or solar energy for example - is now cheaper than electricity powered by coal, oil or gas. 
On the other hand, studies predict that if we don't act on climate change by 2050, the global economy could shrink by 18% because of the damage caused by natural disasters and extreme temperatures to buildings, lives, businesses and food supplies. 
Such damage would hit the world's poorest the hardest.
Misleading posts claiming renewable energy failures led to blackouts went viral earlier in the year, when a massive electricity grid failure left millions of Texans in the dark and cold. 
These posts, which were taken up by a number of conservative media outlets in the US, wrongly blamed the blackout on wind turbines. 
""Blackouts are an artefact of poor electricity generation and distribution management,"" says John Gluyas, executive director of the Durham Energy Institute. 
He says the claim that renewable energy causes blackouts is ""nonsensical.... Venezuela has oodles of oil and frequent blackouts"". 
According to Jennie King from the think tank ISD Global, this discrediting of renewable energies is a ""key line of attack for those keen to preserve reliance on, and subsidies for, oil and gas"". 
Critics of renewable energy schemes also claim the technology kills birds and bats, ignoring the studies that estimate that fossil fuel-powered plants kill many times more animals. 
There's no doubt some wildlife, including birds, are killed by wind turbines.
But according to the LSE's Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment: ""The benefits for wildlife of mitigating climate change are considered by conservation charities... to outweigh the risks, provided that the right planning safeguards are put in place, including careful site selection.""

139,General,BBC News,Climate conference pact 'not costless',2021-11-16,"Guernsey was told the cost of not acting over the climate crisis would be ""very expensive indeed""
Changes required under Glasgow Climate Pact will not be ""costless"" for people in Guernsey, a senior politician has been warned.
Deputy Lindsay de Sausmarez, President of Environment and Infrastructure 
said the agreement was not ""as good as people hoped"" but ""we have, without doubt, made progress"".
Deputy de Sausmarez was part of a delegation from the Channel Islands at COP26 which included Deputy Jonathan le Tocq and Jersey External Affairs Minister Senator Ian Gorst. 	
The Glasgow Climate Pact is the first ever climate deal to explicitly plan to reduce coal, but critics have said pledges do not go far enough to limit temperature rise to 1.5C - which was the aim of the summit. 
Deputy de Sausmarez said: ""Itâs certainly not going to be a costless transition.
""However, while there will be some things that become more expensive - either temporarily or permanently - there will be other things that become more affordable. 
""Itâs important we look at things in the proper context, which is the cost of not acting - and that is very expensive indeed.""
Last week, at a march aimed at encouraging Guernseyâs government to tackle climate change, Deputy Peter Roffey suggested making people pay for long-stay parking in St Peter Port may be a way to get people out of their cars and fight greenhouse gas emissions. 
Deputy de Sausmarez said: âYou canât just look at individual bits of the transport strategy in isolation. 
âIt is not providing us with enough options to get around the island easily, safely and affordably enough.""

140,Climate change,BBC News,University alliance takes climate crisis 'action',2021-11-16,"Experts from four universities have come together to form a regional alliance to tackle climate change.
The GW4 Climate Alliance has been formed by researchers from universities in Bath, Bristol, Cardiff and Exeter.
Alliance officials said they want to draw on the area's unique knowledge on environmental issues to create a regional response to the global crisis. 
University students have said they hope it inspires other universities to come together to fight the climate crisis.
The new group said it would deliver specialised climate science to help shape policies.
Bristol University third-year Geography student Isabel Townsend, said the new group is a ""step in the right direction"".
""I hope that other universities follow their lead. We need to see more actions and less pledging,"" she said.
Emily Muir, also at Bristol University, said she was happy social sciences would be included in their research.
""People forget to think about the human impacts on people, their culture and their communities when it comes to climate issues,"" she said
""If we don't come together with our knowledge, things aren't going to happen."" 
GW4 Alliance Director Dr Joanna Jenkinson MBE said the west of England had more climate-related expertise than any other region worldwide.
""The GW4 Climate Alliance is uniquely placed to address the global challenge of climate change, due to both our regional 'ecosystem' and the complementary critical mass of expertise across the GW4 institutions,"" Dr Jenkinson said. 
""This launch is part of our commitment to connecting practitioners, industry, policy makers, researchers, and community groups, and to support the climate research leaders of the present and future.""
University of Exeter professor Tim Lenton said interdisciplinarity research was ""vital to solving the climate crisis"".
""It's being caused by humans and then it manifests both in natural systems and in human systems,"" he said.
""So, if you can't bring together an understanding of those natural systems and those human systems and what motivates us as humans, there's no chance of credible solutions.""

142,COP26,Navin Singh Khadka,COP26: Did India betray vulnerable nations?,2021-11-16,"The Glasgow climate deal has put India and China in the spotlight after they opposed a commitment to ""phase out"" coal while negotiating the final agreement. 
Instead, countries agreed to ""phase down"" coal, causing disappointment and concern over whether the world can limit the average global temperature rise to 1.5C.
""China and India will have to explain themselves and what they did to the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world,"" said the COP26 president, Alok Sharma. Mr Sharma also called the deal ""historic"" and said it ""keeps 1.5C within reach"".
Earlier drafts of the agreement contained an commitment to phase out unabated coal (unabated refers to coal that is burned without carbon capture and storage technology, which advocates say significantly decreases emissions). 
So what happened?
At the start of the summit, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to cut emissions to net zero by 2070, reduce carbon emissions by one billion tonnes by 2030, and raise the share of renewables in the energy mix to 50%, among others.
The ambitious announcements, welcomed then, now stand in stark contrast to India's last-minute intervention to water down the language on coal. 
China, which otherwise shares a tense relationship with its neighbour, was a strong ally throughout the final negotiations.  
The summit was expected to end on Friday but went into overtime until a deal was hammered out late on Saturday night. 
The last day of negotiations saw China argue ""common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities"" or CBDR - it means countries that have signed the UN climate deal have a common responsibility to fight climate change, but have different capacities to do so given that they are in different stages of economic development.
China said that various countries' efforts to meet the 1.5C target should be seen in the context of their efforts to eradicate poverty.
India agreed. ""How can anyone expect that developing countries make promises about phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies? Developing countries still have to do deal with their poverty reduction agenda,"" India's Environment Minister, Bhupender Yadav, said. 
The words ""phasing out unabated coal"" had triggered the argument. Without a consensus, there would be no final text to adopt, and that meant the summit would fail. 
So, key negotiators were seen huddling to secure an agreement ahead of the final session where the deal would be adopted. 
At first, the cameras were focussed on Chinese negotiators, including their leader Xie Zhenhua, who were speaking to US special climate envoy, John Kerry. They were also seen speaking with Mr Sharma. 
Then Mr Yadav was seen talking to Mr Sharma and the two spoke at least twice while everyone waited for the final session to begin.
When it did, India took the floor and sought permission to make a proposal. Mr Yadav proposed that the phrase ""phase out unabated coal"" in the final draft text of the agreement be replaced with ""phase down coal"". 
His words were met with silence barring a few whistles in the background. 
Once the agreement had been finalised, various countries took to the stage to express their disappointment over the  change, arguing that ""phasing out coal"" was a major pillar to keep the 1.5C target alive.
""We do not need to phase down coal but to phase out coal,"" Switzerland said, while calling the process ""untransparent"". 
""The longer you take to phase out coal, the more burden you put on natural environment and your economy,"" EU envoy Frans Timmermans said. 
A heavy round of applause followed the statement. 
Several small island states said keeping 1.5C out of reach would mean a death sentence for them.
Mr Sharma, seemingly on the brink of tears, apologised for the way things had unfolded.
But some experts say this could have been better handled by developed countries.
The emphasis on coal while leaving out oil and gas would disproportionately impact developing countries such as lndia and China, Brandon Wu, director of policy and campaigns at ActionAid, said.
""We would have liked the ""phasing out"" of all fossil fuels and not just coal,"" said Avinash Chanchal, senior climate campaigner, Greenpeace India.
He added that the ""weakened draft reflected the lack of trust among rich and poor countries as previous commitments were not met"".
Developing countries such as India have argued that they are being put under pressure to move from fossil fuels to renewables, while developed countries are not helping them financially and with technology.
""This text has so many lines on mitigation [emissions reduction]. What countries need to do, what they have to submit every year and even the details of upcoming high level meetings etc, but there is nothing on finance. How can we call this a balanced text?"" Mr Yadav said.
India is the third-largest carbon emitter after China and the US but its per capita emissions is around seven times lower than that of the US, according to studies, including one by the World Bank.
An energy secure future is essential for India's economy - which is recovering from the pandemic while also battling sluggish growth - and coal is a big part of that goal.
""The challenge is to make it a just transition to low carbon so that people don't suffer,"" says Chirag Gajjar, an energy expert with World Resources Institute India.
""India's track record with renewables is solid; its target was 20 gigawatts by 2010 and by 2016 it was already heading towards 175 gigawatts. So, if India is able to send the right signal, renewables can grow exponentially.""
If that happens, India will certainly win accolades but for now it has earned criticism for managing to water down what many say is a key commitment to fight global warming. 
Mr Yadav, however, sees it differently. 
""As COP26 draws to a close, I would like to thank the entire team with me in Glasgow that worked hard to make the summit a success for India,"" he has tweeted.

143,Climate change,Marianna Spring,Covid denial to climate denial: How conspiracists are shifting focus,2021-11-16,"Members of an online movement infected with pandemic conspiracies are shifting their focus - and are increasingly peddling falsehoods about climate change. 
Matthew is convinced that shadowy forces lie behind two of the biggest news stories of our time, and that he's not being told the truth. 
""This whole campaign of fear and propaganda is an attempt to try and drive some agenda,"" he says. ""It doesn't matter whether it's climate change or a virus or something else."" 
Originally from the UK, Matthew has been living in New Zealand for the past 20 years. The country is one of several that have aimed to completely stamp out Covid-19 through strict lockdowns. 
Troubled by the New Zealand government's approach, he turned to social media for news and community. The online groups he joined - opposed to vaccines and masks - exposed him to completely unfounded conspiracies about sinister global plots behind the Covid-19 pandemic. 
His immersion in this conspiratorial world has coloured his outlook and affected his relationships. He's speaking to me on a video call while hidden away at the end of his garden, because he's afraid his partner - who doesn't share some of his views - might hear him.
And recently, groups like the ones he's a part of have been sharing misleading claims not only about Covid, but about climate change. He sees ""Covid and climate propaganda"" as part of the same so-called plot. 
It's part of a larger pattern. Anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine Telegram groups, which once focused exclusively on the pandemic, are now injecting the climate change debate with the same conspiratorial narratives they use to explain the pandemic.
The posts go far beyond political criticism and debate - they're full of incorrect information, fake stories and pseudoscience. 
According to researchers at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a think tank that researches global disinformation trends, some anti-lockdown groups have become polluted by misleading posts about climate change being overplayed, or even a so-called ""hoax"" designed to control people. 
""Increasingly, terminology around Covid-19 measures is being used to stoke fear and mobilise against climate action,"" says the ISD's Jennie King.
She says this isn't really about climate as a policy issue.
""It's the fact that these are really neat vectors to get themes like power, personal freedom, agency, citizen against state, loss of traditional lifestyles - to get all of those ideas to a much broader audience."" 
One group which has adopted such ideas is the White Rose - a network with locally-run subgroups around the world, from the UK to the US, Germany and New Zealand - where Matthew came across it.                
""It's not run by any one or two people,"" Matthew explains. ""It's kind of a decentralised community organisation, so you obtain stickers and then post them on lampposts and things like that."" 
These stickers bear slogans with anti-vaccine, anti-mask and conspiratorial content, including slogans such as ""Resist the New Normal"", ""Real Men Don't Wear Masks"", and false statements such as ""There Is No Pandemic"". Matthew first joined his local White Rose channel after seeing it advertised on a sticker - and he now puts up the same slogans on lamp posts around his home near Auckland. 
While we chat, he mentions ""The Great Reset"" - an unfounded conspiracy theory that a global elite is using the pandemic to establish a shadowy New World Order, a ""super-government"" that will control the lives of citizens around the world. 
Although he thinks some of the theories posted online are too conspiratorial, Matthew does believe there's a ""confluence of vested interests, the governments, major corporations"" running the show. 
His views are having a real impact on Matthew's life - setting him apart from those he's closest to. 
Recently, he says, he felt uncomfortable because his nine-year-old daughter was doing a climate change presentation at school. 
At the same time, he regrets falling down a conspiratorial rabbit hole. 
""I have woken up every day the last three or four months, feeling very anxious around the world about the world and what's happening,"" he says. ""And I often wish I hadn't.""
Christine is looking at this from the other side of the coin. She's a nurse in Belfast who has been treating Covid patients. 
During the pandemic, her girlfriend began to believe extreme conspiracies about Covid-19 and vaccines. She even started to think that Christine was part of a vast conspiracy. Just like Matthew, she joined the White Rose channel for her local area. The BBC contacted Telegram for comment. 
""It's crazy. It's scary,"" Christine tells me just before she heads into the hospital for a night shift. 
Her girlfriend then got hooked by false claims about climate change - repeatedly posting about the topic on Instagram. It became so difficult, Christine had to call the relationship quits. 
""She now believes climate change isn't real - and that everything is a scheme to depopulate the Earth and wipe out humanity."" 
Christine shakes her head in despair. 
As the pandemic progresses, vaccines take effect and many countries - particularly rich ones - inch closer to normality, this pivot from Covid towards climate change is something researchers have observed across a number of online spaces.
One way that ISD has seen this play out is around the term ""climate lockdown"". It's used to refer to the completely unfounded idea that in the future we might have Covid-style lockdowns to counteract climate change. 
The term has found popularity with YouTubers who peddle conspiracy theories - but climate scientists say lockdowns would not be a serious climate change mitigation strategy. Covid lockdowns, for instance, only marginally reduced greenhouse gas emissions. 
However, the distress caused by Covid and lockdowns - and the falsehoods that have sprung up around them - have laid the groundwork for yet more conspiracies to spread. A mindset has gripped a group of people who blame all bad news on shady plots by powerful people - rather than accepting the reality about the future of the planet.

The ""Peterborough Climate Commitment"" tells organisations what they can do to tackle climate change.
It was created by the recently formed the Peterborough Climate Change Partnership. 
Carly Leonard, who helped establish the group, said the city had ""pioneered environmental initiatives"".
Ms Leonard, chief executive of environmental charity Peterborough Environment City Trust (PECT), added: ""But time is running short to slow down warming to keep within 1.2C.""
The commitment includes actions for the organisations involved, like monitoring their environmental impact, reducing carbon emissions and improving the natural environment.
A variety of institutions, including education, technology and health bodies, as well as Peterborough City Council, make up the climate change partnership. 
The council has a commitment to be net-zero carbon by 2030 and Peterborough to become a net-zero carbon city by the same date.
Ms Leonard said: ""By organisations working together to make simple and consistent changes we are more likely to achieve the city's net-zero target.""
Net zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
Achieving it means reducing emissions as much as possible, as well as balancing out any that remain by removing an equivalent amount.

147,COP26,BBC News,COP26: University of East Anglia students give their views,2021-11-15,"Pledges to reduce the use of coal and increase financial support for developing countries were part of the deal struck at the end of COP26. What do student activists think of the agreement that came out of the two-week climate change summit in Glasgow?
""Nothing new"" has come out of the negotiations in Glasgow, according to University of East Anglia (UEA) student Meg Watts.
""I feel very strongly that it was a rehashing and watering down of the Paris Agreement,"" she says, referring to the 2015 international treaty on climate change.
The 21-year-old literature and creative writing student says before attending the summit, she was hoping it was going to be ""worth everyone's time"" and there was going to be a green new deal that focussed on radically reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
""But as soon as I arrived in Glasgow, it was clear that was not going to happen,"" she says.
She says even though the Glasgow Climate Pact agrees to ""phase down"" coal, there was no mention of other fossil fuels such as oil and gas, and the pledges, if met, would only limit global warming to 2.4C, which amounts to ""catastrophic climate change"". 
""We're seeing 1.5 degrees and the floods in New York and in Germany, and in the Philippines, and and it's only going to get worse if there is no decisive action,"" she says.
For her, the only positive to come out of COP26 was collaboration between China and the US, the world's two biggest CO2 emitters, who pledged to work together to achieve the 1.5C temperature goal set out in the Paris Agreement.
Otherwise, it was ""worse than I expected"", she says, adding: ""I expected empty promises, but I didn't expect wilful ignorance.""
The Glasgow Climate Pact is the first ever climate deal to explicitly plan to reduce coal, the worst fossil fuel for greenhouse gases.
It also presses for more urgent emission cuts and promises more money for developing countries to help them adapt to climate impacts.
UEA medical student Amit Singh, chair of the national committee COP26 working group for Students for Global Health. says he is ""disappointed"" with the agreement, reached after COP26 went into overtime on Saturday.
The 20-year-old, who attended the conference, says even though getting fossil fuels mentioned for the first time was a ""great win"", he is disappointed that the agreement was to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal.
The wording change was made after a late intervention by China and India.
""It's a significant difference and means people can keep using coal,"" he says. 
""India and China have had a lot of backlash and they have done a massive disservice but there are people running the show in the background who are getting away with so, so much.""
Mr Singh says he is also disappointed that, after resistance from the United States, the European Union and some other rich nations, the deal failed to secure the establishment of a dedicated new damages fund to support the rising costs of losses and damage in developing countries.
He is, however, ""proud"" to help get human health recognised as a ""big factor"" and for fossil fuels to be mentioned for the first time.
""These two weeks are not going to save the world. We can continue to make changes and to hold fossil fuel companies to account,"" he adds.
Like Miss Watts and Mr Singh, Ekaterina Dudakova is also concerned the pledges do not go far enough to limit temperature rise to 1.5C.
The 21-year-old UEA student says: ""The fact that we are receiving reports from scientists which are warning us that if we stick to the promises made at this year's COP, we are going to have a 2.4C rise by 2030, instead of promised 1.5, already speaks a lot about what COP26 has meant for the planet.""
Like Mr Singh, she agrees it is ""reassuring"" to see specific mentions of fossil fuels in the agreement, but is dismayed at the use of ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"".
The organiser of UEA COP26 Festival is also concerned that there is no proper plan for loss and damage. 
The third-year English Literature and Drama student says, in her opinion, the COP26 negotiations were a demonstration of the ""world's biggest act of greenwashing and speculation"". 
""COP should not be a field of vanity fair for politicians and corporations,"" she says.
""If the governments do actually care about people they are representing, they have to prove us that and act now.""
As part of the agreement struck in Glasgow, countries will meet next year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of reaching the 1.5C goal.

148,COP26,BBC News,COP26: What was agreed at the Glasgow climate conference?,2021-11-15,"A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit.
It aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough.
The agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade:
Emissions
It was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a greenhouse gas which causes climate change.
This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. 
Coal
For the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions.  
However, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal after a late intervention by China and India. 
Developing countries
The agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy.
There's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (Â£72bn) a year by 2020 was missed.
While some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the ""start of a breakthrough"", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. 
Fossil fuel subsidies
World leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas.
However, no firm dates have been set.
A flurry of other announcements were made:
The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, pledged to cooperate more over the next decade in areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy.
China has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. 
Leaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - promised to stop deforestation by 2030.
This is seen as vital, as tress absorb vast amounts of CO2. 
Similar initiatives haven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed.
A scheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030 was agreed by more than 100 countries. 
Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. 
The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later.
Financial organisations controlling $130tn agreed to back ""clean"" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries.
The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets.
However, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. 
Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed.
Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. 
COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015 Paris Agreement. 
Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C.
COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. 
The goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reach net zero by mid-century.
Next year's COP27 summit is in Egypt.

149,COP26,Helen Briggs,COP26: How might decisions at the climate summit change our lives?,2021-11-15,"Now that a deal has been agreed and signed at the climate summit in Glasgow, you might be left wondering what it will mean for you. 
Here are some ways in which the decisions made at COP26 could change your life.
Switching to an electric car is among a number of lifestyle changes we're likely to be making.
Experts predict that new electric vehicles could cost the same as new petrol or diesel cars within the next five years. It is also possible to lease an electric vehicle, and there's a growing second-hand market, where these vehicles are cheaper.
Dozens of countries, regions and car companies have agreed to ramp up the use of electric vehicles and bring in new zero-emission buses and trucks. 
Meanwhile, others argue we need fewer cars on the road - walking and cycling more could also be among the changes we make.
How can an average family afford an electric car?
More than 40 countries have signed up to phasing out coal. A similar number have committed to ensuring that clean energy is the most reliable and affordable option for powering our homes and businesses.  
For countries like the UK, this will mean continuing the move towards renewable sources such as wind and solar energy - and possibly more reliance on nuclear energy. 
COP26 lacked a breakthrough announcement committing the world's biggest coal-users such as China and India to ending its use.
However, it's hoped the announcements made at Glasgow will send a signal to the market that it is worth investing in renewable energy. 
Solar panels and heat pumps could become standard in our homes. We'll build new houses using low-carbon alternatives to cement and concrete - and try to re-fit old ones.
There's also a focus on making sure our buildings, infrastructure and communities are able to withstand the current and future impact of climate change.
Eva Hinkers, Arup Sustainable Development Director says: ""We also need to make sure [buildings] are fit for more extreme scenarios."" 
This could include improving green space in and around our homes to absorb extreme rainfall, installing ""cool roofs"" that reflect sunlight and prevent overheating, or introducing shutters so homes can withstand hurricane winds.
Our lifestyles contribute to carbon emissions, whether we're shopping for imported food, or flying off on a foreign holiday.
In future, we may see the cost of a product's carbon emissions being added to the price we pay - whether or not it's made in the UK.
So if a business doesn't try and reduce the emissions of the goods it's selling, its prices may have to go up. It's hoped that will make consumers and businesses think again about how we consume and where we put our money.
In response to this, some big household names like Amazon, Unilever and Ikea have now said they're looking to ensure the cargo ships they use to deliver goods will run on cleaner fuels. 
Nature's role in fighting climate change and the need to restore the natural world - from forests to peatland - was high on the agenda at Glasgow, and we may see the benefits in greener spaces around our towns and cities.
""Nature can be helping us here if we looked to actually treat it with the respect it deserves,"" says Dr Emily Shukburgh of the University of Cambridge. 
The arguments to make space for nature are now clearer and louder than ever, âsays Craig Bennett, chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts.  ""There is now renewed momentum about the need to... protect forests and other precious habitats and put nature in recovery."" 
More than 100 countries signed up to the Glasgow Leaders Declaration on Forests, which aims to halt deforestation. 
This could see tougher action on cutting down forests in countries including Brazil and Indonesia to produce things such as soya, beef and palm oil which are then imported and consumed in richer, developed nations. This could end the era of cheap food.
Experts say that a hard choice could be faced - deforestation will never be stopped if sustainability concerns are always out-competed by the price people pay for food:
""Consumers will inevitably have to absorb some of these costs if we want to deliver on the COP 26 declaration - by paying more and consuming less,"" says Toby Gardner of the Stockholm Environment Institute.
More than 400 financial institutions - controlling an estimated $130tn of private finance - agreed at COP26 to provide more money for green technology. 
It means that many major pension providers are going to be looking at investing your money in more environmentally friendly sectors. 
This might include ""helping our customers identify ways to improve the energy efficiency of their homesâ¦ investing in companies developing new, sustainable ways of living and working,"" says Janet Pope of Lloyds Banking Group.
We may also witness a shift in our way of thinking. 
Dr Stephanie Sodero of the University of Manchester says the goal of sticking to 1.5 degrees - above which scientists say climate impacts will become more dangerous and unpredictable - could galvanise community action.
""On the ground, in UK communities and beyond, led by youth activists, I think there will be sustained and intense pressure to scrutinise all governance decisions - from local transport to national energy - through a climate lens,"" she says.
Matthew Hannon from the University of Strathclyde says the drive to net zero is likely to yield benefits such as cleaner air, quieter streets and better mental and physical health. 
""Delivering a just, net zero transition should ultimately result in happier, healthier lifestyles,"" he says. ""The question should therefore be less about what will I lose under net zero and more about what could I gain?""

150,COP26,Glenn Campbell,Glasgow's name will reverberate into the future,2021-11-15,"Having belched out harmful quantities of carbon in its industrial past, Glasgow now has a global climate pact to its name that will reverberate into the future. 
The deal struck in Scotland's largest city will not, in itself, save the world from the worst effects of warming but it may just sustain that possibility. 
COP26 President, Alok Sharma said it kept alive, albeit with a ""weak pulse"", the target of limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
That's the level above which scientists believe the consequences of climate change will be most dangerous, especially for low-lying island states.
To achieve 1.5 degrees, the Glasgow climate pact is counting on governments around the world making big new carbon-cutting promises next year and keeping all their existing commitments.
The deal includes, for the first time, an acknowledgement that coal is part of the problem although it leaves lots of wriggle room for countries that want to keep burning it. 
As COP26 president, 'No drama Sharma' fought back tears when India and China moved at the last minute to water down language on phasing out coal.
That agreement between almost 200 countries was still reached is a significant achievement for him. 
He has impressed, among others, Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon who paid tribute to him and his negotiating team for their ""hard work and commitment"".
She was less generous about Boris Johnson, suggesting that ""history may judge"" him for not doing more himself to secure the best possible outcome.
Downing Street news releases suggest the prime minister continued to work on several world leaders by phone even if he only spent a few days in Glasgow. 
By contrast, Ms Sturgeon was a constant presence at COP26 even though the devolved Scottish government had no formal role in the negotiations.
The conference has been her primary focus for the past fortnight, with two Covid statements missed and a Holyrood question time delegated to her deputy, John Swinney.
Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross does not criticise her directly for that but wonders what ""tangible outcomes"" have been achieved from such a considerable time commitment.
The same question is often asked when leaders travel abroad and it can be difficult to quantify the return on promoting Scotland and trying to build good relations internationally.
Overseas trips were put on hold during the pandemic but the first minister has now had two weeks to make up for two years of lost diplomacy with the whole world coming to Glasgow. 
Nicola Sturgeon told the BBC that COP26 had been a positive showcase for Glasgow and Scotland and that she had ""spoken to lots of investors who are now looking to invest in green technology here"".
That, at least, could develop into a tangible outcome. 
The benefit question probably does not arise if you happen to work in the marketing department at AG Barr, which has enjoyed invaluable publicity for Irn Bru.
When the first minister introduced US congresswoman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Scotland's other national drink, she endorsed it to the millions who follow her on social media. 
Ms Sturgeon has rubbed shoulders with a galaxy of political stars during COP including the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, US house speaker Nancy Pelosi and climate activists Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate. 
There was even a little face time with US President Joe Biden and his climate envoy John Kerry - courtesy and recognition from the White House, that was unthinkable during the Trump era.
Scotland's international relations are specifically reserved to the UK government and parliament but successive devolved administrations have been expanding their activities in this area. 
As well as doing lots of talking during COP, the Scottish government has also taken action by being among the first ""international actors"" to pay up for the ""loss and damage"" caused by climate change in the developing world.
It has given Â£2 million to a fund to compensate poorer countries and in doing so has encouraged philanthropists and the government of Wallonia to contribute a further Â£3m.
These are small but symbolic contributions for which the UN has expressed appreciation. The head of Greenpeace International, Jennifer Morgan said it was an example for the UK and other countries to follow.
Overall, WWF Scotland's Lang Banks thinks Scotland has played a ""positive role"" at COP26 but called for ""stronger action, more quickly"" on carbon reduction because domestic targets have been missed over the past three years.
Catching up will require a big push to decarbonise homes, transport and major industrial sites like the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemicals plants run by Ineos.
In the latest episode of BBC Scotland's No Hot Air podcast, the chairman of Ineos Grangemouth, Andrew Gardner warns that both the Scottish and UK governments will struggle to meet their net zero ambitions without carbon capture and storage.
He said he was ""shocked"" that the Scottish carbon capture cluster, the Acorn project, had not been given priority by UK ministers who have said they are still ""committed"" to its development. 
The Scottish government has drawn criticism from Friends of the Earth Scotland for not joining a new alliance of countries seeking to phase out oil and gas.
Friends of the Earth Scotland's Dr Richard Dixon said ""Nicola Sturgeon is keen to use the language of climate justice and be photographed with Greta Thunberg but at some point her fine rhetoric has to translate into a commitment to stopping the oil and gas production that is driving the climate crisis"". 
The first minister, who has already ditched a policy of extracting maximum economic value from the North Sea, said it was ""highly likely"" her administration would become an associate member of BOGA, the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, founded by Denmark and Costa Rica.
That again would be largely symbolic as oil and gas licences are issued by UK authorities who are currently considering giving approval to the controversial new Cambo field, west of Shetland. 
The UK has not joined the alliance or set an end date for fossil fuel extraction. Oil and gas remains a major industry in Scotland, supporting around a hundred thousand jobs. 
COP has brought an intense and necessary focus to all of these issues. 
In bringing the event to Glasgow, the UK government has probably sought to demonstrate how the Union can benefit Scotland.
It has also given the leader of Scotland's independence movement, Nicola Sturgeon a massive international platform.
The first minister has used it, principally, to advocate the same carbon cutting agenda as the UK and and UN.
However, in committing cash to ""loss and damage"" she has also created a distinctively Scottish position that invites anyone so inclined to imagine what role an independent Scotland might play.
If that has irked the UK government it has not said so publicly. A statement issued mid-way through the conference said it was ""grateful for the contributions of all the first ministers from across the UK"".
Having said that, there has been some private frustration. As COP26 closed, the first minister issued her response almost a full hour before the UK government with one UK official grumbling to me about what he considered discourtesy.
These tensions are never far from the surface in Scottish politics and will probably become more apparent now that the COP is over. But with the planet in crisis, we can ill-afford a politics that returns entirely to business as usual.

151,COP26,Rajini Vaidyanathan,A watered-down COP26 deal as Delhi chokes,2021-11-15,"India is accused of watering down a COP26 climate deal to cut coal consumption even as toxic air chokes its national capital, Delhi. 
Air quality in the city has been hovering between ""severe"" and ""hazardous"" for several days now. The Delhi government on Sunday announced that schools would close for week and said it was mulling over a ""lockdown"" to improve air quality. 
Burning of crop stubble, industrial and vehicular pollution, and weather patterns turn the city's air noxious every winter. 
But the air in the capital - and large parts of northern India - remains poor most of the year. Pollutants from coal-fired power plants are among the culprits. 
Despite pressure on India and China, two of the world's top carbon emitters, to sign a deal to end coal use, the two big consumers of coal proposed a last-minute change in wording - countries have now agreed to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal.   
The news of the change made big headlines around the world with many heaping scorn and disappointment on India for desperately clinging to coal. 
But in a growing country which still derives around 70% of its energy from coal, the decision was seen as pragmatic and assertive. 
India's Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav, who was at the Glasgow summit, said India had achieved ""remarkable results"", but it's all about striking a balance. He said he had articulated the concerns and ideas of other developing nations, who also rely on fossil fuels to power growth.
The narrative in many parts of the media was that India stood up to the world and came home with what it wanted.
""India has maintained that the current climate crisis has been precipitated by unsustainable lifestyles and wasteful consumption patterns mainly in the developed countries. The world needs to awaken to this reality,"" Mr Yadav wrote in a blog.
Jairam Ramesh, a former environment minister from the opposition Congress party, said the outcome this year was ""the best India can offer"".
""India has to be responsive globally and responsible domestically,"" he said.
And millions of Indians, who are still reeling from the effects of a devastating second Covid wave, see getting the economy back on its feet as the biggest priority. For now that means clinging to coal while scaling up cleaner alternatives. 
""Solar is extremely important - it's growing very fast but you can't replace coal with solar in such a short period of time,"" said Vaibhav Chaturvedi from the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW). The economist has just returned from the COP26 summit where he also advised the Indian delegation. 
""Both are going to grow in the next 10 years. Solar will grow very fast, coal will grow slowly,"" he added. 
At the COP26 summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to hit net zero emissions by 2070 - two decades later than many Western nations have pledged. 
But many are quick to point out that the average Indian consumes far less energy than the average Briton or American - and that Western countries haven't done all that they have promised either, including providing much-needed climate finance to help poorer countries meet their targets. 
""It's very hard for India or any developing country to trust the developed nations now,"" Mr Chaturvedi argues.
""The West has not delivered when it comes to cutting their emissions, that's the reality of it.""

152,COP26,BBC News,COP26: 'Hope delivered but delayed' - Wales reacts to deal,2021-11-14,"""Hope delivered but hope delayed"".
That is the assessment of Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford after a deal was reached at the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow on Saturday evening.
It is the first ever climate deal that explicitly plans to reduce coal, but the reaction has been mixed after China and India insisted the language on coal was watered down.
Mr Drakeford said he still believed the summit delivered hope of averting the worst effects of climate change.
""If I was summarising I'd say it was a combination of hope delivered, because there are some very important things that were achieved at COP,"" he said.
""Hope delayed, because there are some things that will need to go on being discussed beyond Glasgow.
""But definitely not hope destroyed, which [was] the biggest fear in advance of the conference.""
The summit, initially due to end on Friday, had to go into overtime before a deal was agreed late on Saturday - following an intervention from India to change the language on coal from ""phase out"" to ""phase down"".
The United Nations climate chief Patricia Espinosa said the agreement was a ""huge step forward"" in ending the reliance on coal - the worst fossil fuel for greenhouse gases - while Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""game-changing"".
Wales' first minister emphasised that the pledge from delegates to meet for further discussions next year was welcome, but acknowledged the current deal would not be sufficient to keep global temperature rises to 1.5C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
""If we simply stayed with what COP has agreed, that would be the case"", he said.
""That's why some hope is deferred, because there is a need for further conversation to do more that still can be done to make sure we are able to stay within those Paris goals.""

Plaid Cymru described the deal reached at COP26 as a step - rather than a stride - in the right direction which signified the ""bare minimum"" needed to tackle the climate emergency.
However, despite his frustration, party leader Adam Price said Wales and other small nations could still lead the way.
""The lack of ambition demonstrated by some of the most powerful nations must not hamper the ability of small, agile nations such as Wales to act independently and cut emissions,"" he said.
""We are already world leaders in recycling and have huge untapped potential in terms of natural resources.
""There is no doubt that every one of us will be impacted by this global emergency in turn, and every one of us has a duty to do what we can to combat it.""
Under the Glasgow climate pact:
Dr Jen Allan, an expert in international relations from Cardiff University, said there should be realistic expectations at what could be achieved at one conference.
""No one COP can save the world,"" she said.
""We're talking about massively changing our societies and economies in a decade, so one COP can be an important stepping stone.
""It can put the pieces in place that we need to help stand on that foundation. 
""But we can't tomorrow say, 'great, we've saved the world, job done'. All the work has to happen at home.""
Wales was the only UK nation to sign up to a new alliance of nations committed to phasing out oil and gas.
""Wales has done really well at this COP,"" said Dr Allen.
""I think they've found other nations around the world that share similar values, that have similar challenges and there's been a tonne of outreach. 
""Joining the 'beyond oil and gas alliance' puts Wales on the map as one of the leading nations that say 'look, we need to move past fossil fuels, and we're going to start thinking in a serious way about how to do that'.""

153,COP26,Doug Faulkner,COP26: Climate deal sounds the death knell for coal power - PM,2021-11-14,"The Glasgow climate deal is a ""game-changing agreement"" which sounds ""the death knell for coal power"", Boris Johnson says. 
Although countries only agreed to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal, the prime minister said this was a fantastic achievement.
The wording change was made after a late intervention by China and India.
But it remains the first time plans to reduce coal have been mentioned in such a climate deal.
The agreement was reached after the two-week Glasgow COP26 summit went into overtime on Saturday. 
Critics have said the deal does not go far enough and will not meet the key summit goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C by the end of the century.
Scientists say this would limit the worst impacts of climate change.
During a Downing Street news conference, Mr Johnson said: 
Mr Johnson said that despite the achievements of the summit, his reaction was ""tinged with disappointment"".
He said there had been a high level of ambition - especially from countries where climate change was already ""a matter of life and death"". 
And ""while many of us were willing to go there, that wasn't true of everybody"", he admitted.
But he added the UK could not compel nations to act. ""It's ultimately their decision to make and they must stand by it.""
Mr Johnson also said he thought the watered-down language on coal did not ""make that much of a difference"", adding that the direction of travel was ""pretty much the same"".
He said most of Western Europe and North America had been persuaded to pull the plug on financial support for overseas fossil fuel projects by this time next year.
""And when you add all that together, it is beyond question, Glasgow has sounded the death knell for coal power,"" he said.
Speaking alongside the PM, COP26 president Alok Sharma revealed that at one point during the final negotiations, he had feared the agreement was in jeopardy.
""There was an hour where really we weren't going to get a deal,"" he said.
Mr Sharma, who fought back tears as he closed the summit following the late intervention, said: ""I can tell you there was one really tense hour where I did feel the weight of the world on my shoulders... this deal was absolutely in jeopardy. We got it over the line.""
Earlier he said that ""China and India will have to explain themselves"" to climate-vulnerable nations.
One of the main goals set out by COP26 was to ensure global warming does not go above 1.5C by 2100 - but a report by the Climate Action Tracker group has calculated that at the current rate, the world is heading for 2.4C warming by that date. 
As part of the agreement struck in Glasgow, countries will meet next year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of reaching the 1.5C goal. 
Under the Glasgow climate pact:
The UN's climate change chief Patricia Espinosa described the mention of fossil fuels as a ""huge step forward"" but added there was a need to ""balance out the social consequences"" for people of cutting coal power - particularly in poor countries.
She said that the 1.5C target was ""definitely alive"" but, earlier, Labour's shadow business and energy secretary Ed Miliband said the goal was ""in intensive care"".

It comes after the two nations pushed for the language on coal to change from ""phase out"" to ""phase down"" in the deal agreed in Glasgow.
But Mr Sharma insisted the ""historic"" deal ""keeps 1.5C within reach"".
It is the first ever climate deal that plans explicitly to reduce coal - the worst fossil fuel for greenhouse gases.
The summit, which was initially due to end on Friday, had to go into overtime before a deal was agreed late on Saturday - following the late intervention from India to water down the language on coal. 
Later on Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will join Mr Sharma to give a Downing Street news conference on the outcome of the climate summit.
Mr Sharma said the deal struck in the Glasgow climate pact was a ""fragile win"" and urged China and India to ""justify"" their actions to nations that are more vulnerable to the effects of global warming.
He told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""I am going to be calling on everyone to do more. 
""But as I said, in relation to what happened yesterday, China and India will have to explain themselves and what they did to the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world.""
Mr Sharma, who had to hold back tears as he closed the summit following the late intervention, added: ""I wouldn't describe what we did yesterday as a failure - it is a historic achievement.""
China teaming up with India to water down the language will have come as something of a blow to those who wanted a much more ambitious outcome at the conference.
However - perhaps they should not be too pessimistic about the final agreement.
For example, here in Beijing the Communist Party's media mouthpiece Xinhua wire service is already stressing in its commentaries that coal is ""the dominant source of carbon dioxide emissions in the process of electricity generation"".
It may sound like that is just stating the obvious - but such wording from Xinhua represents a transmission of the party line across the country: coal is the biggest part of the problem!
Beijing knows that ultimately the writing is on the wall for coal, but it's the speed of its phase out which matters to the Chinese government.
It believes that the most developed countries got the world into this problem in the first place - enriching themselves along the way - so now argues that countries like China need to be cut more slack to catch up.
What's also being stressed here from the Chinese delegation has been the perceived shortfall from advanced countries to deliver on their promises to provide finance and technological support for developing countries to help them move to cleaner energy.
Vice Minister Zhao Yingmin, who headed China's team in Glasgow, said he hoped developed countries could ""make further efforts to honour their commitments, enhancing support for developing countries, instead of merely urging other parties to raise their ambitions"".
One of the main goals set out by COP26 was to ensure we do not go above 1.5C by 2100 - which scientists have said would limit the worst impacts of climate change. 
As part of the agreement struck in Glasgow, countries will meet next year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of reaching the 1.5C goal. Current pledges, if fulfilled, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C.
Scientists have warned if global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C the Earth is likely to experience severe effects such as millions more people being exposed to extreme heat. The world is currently 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century. 
Under the Glasgow climate pact:
The final deal agreed on has been met with some criticism.
Ed Miliband, shadow business and energy secretary, told the Sky News' Trevor Phillips programme that ""keeping 1.5 degrees alive is frankly in intensive care"".  
He said the world's task was to halve global emissions by 2030 and said that despite some progress in Glasgow ""the world is only probably about 20% or 25% of the way to that goal"".
But Mr Miliband commended Mr Sharma on his efforts. 
The UN's climate change chief, Patricia Espinosa, described the mention of coal and fossil fuels as a ""huge step forward"".
But she added that ""we need to also balance out the social consequences for so many people around the world, especially in the poor countries"".
Lord Deben, the chairman of the Climate Change Committee, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that the UK should negotiate future trade deals with ""some congruence with the world battle on climate change"" - pointing to Australia as an example.
""I hope our government will also recognise that you really cannot sign trade deals on the basis that Australia can do nothing to insist on their farmers meeting the challenge of climate change and then export their goods to Britain,"" he said.
He added that India's push to change the language on coal was a ""misuse"" of the process.
A report by the Climate Action Tracker group has calculated that at the current rate, the world is heading for 2.4C of warming by 2100. 
If no action was taken, scientists believe global warming could exceed 4C in the future. This could lead to devastating heatwaves, droughts, extreme rainfall and floods. As a result, millions of people could lose their homes to rising sea levels. 
In addition to this, the change in climate could lead to irreversible damage to our ecosystem - with the mass extinction of animal and plant species.

158,COP26,Chris Morris,COP 26: How much are poor countries getting to fight climate change?,2021-11-14,"The amount of money rich countries give to the developing world to help it cope with climate change was one of the big battles of the COP26 climate summit. 
A pledge to provide $100bn (Â£72bn) a year by 2020 has not been met, and poorer countries are demanding action. 
It is going to be hard enough for rich countries to adjust to the need to remove fossil fuels and carbon from their economies. 
But it is going to be far more challenging in developing nations, where there is much less money to pay for new infrastructure and technology. 
And there are an awful lot of people under threat. 
That's why developing countries are demanding grants, loans and private investment to support efforts to adapt to climate change and mitigate its effects. 
Coastal defences to protect against flood surges and the creation of agricultural systems less vulnerable to drought are key areas where the developing world needs urgent financial help to adapt to changing conditions.
And for the poorest countries to be part of efforts to mitigate against the effects of climate change, support is needed for a switch to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and hydro power.
As long ago as 2009, the developed world agreed it would provide $100bn a year by 2020 to help poorer countries.
But an expert report commissioned by the United Nations (UN) concludes the target has not been reached - even though a new and more ambitious target is now due to be set for 2025. 
""The $100bn commitment should be seen as a floor not a ceiling,"" lead author Amar Bhattacharya, from the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, says.
""Some progress has been made - but a lot more needs to be done.""
For many countries, this has been the biggest issue to resolve at COP26.
Climate finance is available to a wide range of countries. It includes the very poorest nations but also big economies like China and Brazil which are growing rapidly but are still far behind the rich world in terms of average income per person. 
In the weeks leading up to and during the first few days of the summit a number of countries announced new climate finance pledges.
It is quite hard to calculate what money should be included in the overall figure, because it is a complicated mix of funding from governments, international lenders and private companies. 
But the existing pledges have been estimated to amount to $96bn a year by the end of 2022.
The UK government has said it is confident the $100bn target will be met in 2023.
The LDC group representing the least developed nations says this delay is unacceptable.
""Delivering US$100 billion by 2023 isn't soon enough"", says the LDC's Gebru Jember, adding that ""there is not enough for adapting to climate change, which was promised to be 50% of the US$100 billion.""
There had been efforts at COP26 to address that by urging rich countries to at least double the amount of money they give for adaptation to climate change by 2025 (from 2019 levels).  But that language was watered down in the final Glasgow Climate Pact to merely refer to an increase.
Proposals were also discussed at Glasgow for a longer term, more ambitious target for climate financing. Many developing countries want to see at least $1tn a year by 2030. 
Finally, there are demands for a separate stream of finance dealing with loss and damage - effectively compensation for the harm done by all the greenhouse gases emitted by the industrialised world over the past 200 years.
But rich countries have already ruled out any language which suggests formal liability for damages which could run into trillions of dollars. 
""Within the G7 [group of rich nations], the three countries that have been the leaders are Germany, Japan and France in that order,"" Mr Bhattacharya says. 
The recent additional pledges from the US and UK put them back among the leading group of contributors. But the US is still falling well short of what is considered to be its fair share given its size and resources. 
Experts say rich countries which have been responsible for huge amounts of carbon emissions need to go further. 
Dr Alina Averchenkova, from the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, says: ""$100bn isn't going to do it - we need to move trillions in both public and private money"". 
""The pandemic has shown us it can be done when there is the political will. 
Yes. By 2018, about three-quarters of the government money made available for climate action in developing countries was in the form of loans that need to be paid back, rather than grants that do not. 
And that is a big problem in countries - many already heavily in debt - where Covid has made access to international funds even more pressing.
There has been an agreement at COP26 to give more money in the form of grants rather than loans, but the details of that commitment are limited.
""Developing countries cannot just rely on loans, so it is going to be really important that more climate finance is provided in grants,"" Dr Averchenkova says. 
So it is the quality as well as the quantity of funding that matters. 
And the message from the world's poorer countries is pretty simple - if you want ambitious climate targets, you are going to have to pay for them.

159,Our Planet Now,Paul Rincon,COP26: New global climate deal struck in Glasgow,2021-11-14,"A deal aimed at staving off dangerous climate change has been struck at the COP26 summit in Glasgow.
The Glasgow Climate Pact is the first ever climate deal to explicitly plan to reduce coal, the worst fossil fuel for greenhouse gases.
The deal also presses for more urgent emission cuts and promises more money for developing countries - to help them adapt to climate impacts.
But the pledges don't go far enough to limit temperature rise to 1.5C.
A commitment to phase out coal that was included in earlier negotiation drafts led to a dramatic finish after India and China led opposition to it.
India's climate minister Bhupender Yadav asked how developing countries could promise to phase out coal and fossil fuel subsidies when they ""have still to deal with their development agendas and poverty eradication"". 
In the end, countries agreed to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal, amid expressions of disappointment by some. COP26 President Alok Sharma said he was ""deeply sorry"" for how events had unfolded.
He fought back tears as he told delegates that it was vital to protect the agreement as a whole.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he hoped the world would ""look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change"".
""There is still a huge amount more to do in the coming years. But today's agreement is a big step forward and, critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a roadmap to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees,"" he said.
John Kerry, the US envoy for climate, said it was always unlikely that the Glasgow summit would result in a decision that ""was somehow going to end the crisis"", but that the ""starting pistol"" had been fired.
Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the planet was ""hanging by a thread"". ""We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe... it is time to go into emergency mode - or our chance of reaching net zero will itself be zero.""
As part of the agreement, countries will meet next year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of reaching the 1.5C goal. Current pledges, if fulfilled, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C.
If global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, scientists say the Earth is likely to experience severe effects such as millions more people being exposed to extreme heat.
Main achievements of the deal:
""We would like to express our profound disappointment that the language we agreed on, on coal and fossil fuels subsidies, has been further watered down,"" Swiss environment minister Simonetta Sommaruga said. ""This will not bring us closer to 1.5C, but make it more difficult to reach it.""
Despite the weakening of language around coal, some observers will still see the deal as a victory, underlining that it is the first time coal is explicitly mentioned in UN documents of this type.
Coal is responsible for about 40% of annual CO2 emissions, making it central in efforts to keep within the 1.5C target. To meet this goal, agreed in Paris in 2015, global emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and to nearly zero by mid-century.
""They changed a word but they can't change the signal coming out of this COP - that the era of coal is ending,"" said Greenpeace international executive director Jennifer Morgan.
However, Lars Koch, a policy director for charity ActionAid, said it was disappointing that only coal was mentioned.
""This gives a free pass to the rich countries who have been extracting and polluting for over a century to continue producing oil and gas,"" he said.
Sara Shaw, from Friends of the Earth International, said the outcome was ""nothing less than a scandal"". 
""Just saying the words 1.5 degrees is meaningless if there is nothing in the agreement to deliver it. COP26 will be remembered as a betrayal of global South countries,"" she said. 
Finance was a contentious issue during the conference. A pledge by developed nations to provide $100bn (Â£75bn) per year to emerging economies, made in 2009, was supposed to have been delivered by 2020. However, the date was missed.
It was designed to help developing nations adapt to climate effects and make the transition to clean energy. In an effort to mollify delegates, Mr Sharma said around $500bn would be mobilised by 2025.
But poorer countries had been calling throughout the meeting for funding through the principle of loss and damage - the idea that richer countries should compensate poorer ones for climate change effects they are unable to adapt to.
This was one of the big disappointments of the conference for many delegations. Despite their dissatisfaction, several countries that stood to benefit backed the agreement on the basis that talks on loss and damage would continue.
Delegations pushing for greater progress on the issue included those from countries in Africa, such as Guinea and Kenya, as well as Latin American states, small island territories and nations in Asia such as the Philippines.
Lia Nicholson, delegate for Antigua and Barbuda, and speaking on behalf of small island states, said: ""We recognise the presidency's efforts to try and create a space to find common ground. The final landing zone, however, is not even close to capturing what we had hoped.""
Shauna Aminath, environment minister for the low-lying Maldives, said: ""We have 98 months to halve global emissions. The difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees is a death sentence for us.""

160,COP26,Steffan Messenger,Climate change: Five things I've learned covering COP26,2021-11-14,"The biggest political summit in UK history is drawing to a close, with tens of thousands of weary delegates from almost 200 countries waving goodbye to Glasgow.
After a fortnight of frantic negotiations - they've sealed a new deal on fighting climate change.
There's still a lot of debate about whether it's ambitious enough.
But there's no doubt it will have implications for all of us in our day-to-day lives.
It will help shape the policies to cut planet-warming gases from a UK and Welsh government level, right down to your local council.
I've been in Glasgow for the past fortnight covering the story for BBC Wales News, and here are five points I have taken from the experience.
I was glared at by Greta Thunberg at the youth protest march.
""What's your message to the world leaders?"", I had shouted out in a vain attempt to secure BBC Wales an exclusive.
A stupid question really as the teenager - nominated three times for a Nobel Peace Prize for her climate activism - had already spoken out loud and clear.
No more ""blah-blah-blah"" became, for many, the unofficial slogan of this summit.

We caught up with Wales' Youth Climate Ambassadors several times during their busy schedule at COP26.
""Young people have shown real climate leadership - if those currently in positions of power can't, then they should step aside and let those who can fill their seats,"" urged 19-year-old Molly from Ebbw Vale.
I found them to be among the most impressive interviewees I spoke to.
Take note - some of our future leaders are among this bunch.
Holding a mass-gathering during the pandemic meant strict safety measures and daily testing for all attending.
But being a fly on the wall as talks took place, including one furious row that exploded on a table next to me on one eventful day, made you realise why the organisers had pushed so hard not to revert to Zoom.
""They always say about COPs that the really important conversations happen in the corridors and coffee shops,"" explained Prof Mary Gagen, a climate scientist from Swansea University.
""One of the most important things about this being a physical COP is that those informal conversations then get taken into the negotiating room.""
Looking people in the eye had an obvious impact on Welsh government ministers attending too.
We interviewed Climate Change Minister Julie James just moments after she had held a meeting with the Wampis indigenous people of Peru.
She appeared so taken aback by what she'd heard about the impact of tree-felling on their rainforest community that she pledged to change rules around public procurement - so schools and hospitals for instance have to make sure the goods they buy in from abroad are deforestation-free.
It was a commitment that even took her officials by surprise.
We tend to turn a blind eye to the impact our consumption is having overseas.
Targets to cut greenhouse gases only focus on domestic emissions - not issues in other countries caused by demand here in Wales.
We got our hands on a report from environment charities that showed an area 40% the size of Wales is needed to grow a handful of key agricultural commodities to satisfy our demands.
Soya plantations producing animal feed for livestock is one of the biggest problems.
Rivelino Vera Gabriel - a chief of the Guarani people of Brazil's Atlantic forest - told us people buying soya ""to feed a chicken in Wales, for example, needed to know where it was coming from"".
Otherwise it brings ""not only deforestation but indigenous blood"".
If emissions targets are to be met, we're on the cusp of unprecedented change.
Different energy sources are needed, a different landscape with more trees to soak in carbon dioxide and a plethora of different green jobs.

There was a big focus at the Welsh side-events at COP on how this could all happen fairly - and not end up making disadvantaged communities even poorer.
But it struck me that not many voices from those areas had made it to Glasgow to be part of the debate.
We spoke with one huge firm hoping to bring economic renewal to parts of Anglesey and Gwynedd.
In his first TV interview of the COP summit, Tom Samson - the boss of Rolls Royce's new project to develop a series of smaller factory-built nuclear reactors across the UK, told us Wylfa on Anglesey was top of their list of potential locations.
They're eyeing the former nuclear site at Trawsfynydd in Gwynedd too - and are excited about the opportunities it could provide local people.
But with a long-term storage facility for the UK's nuclear waste still not sorted out, there's vocal opposition as well.
Campaigner Robat Idris said these communities' economies had been left to dwindle as previous plans for new nuclear projects failed to materialise.
Every pound spent on nuclear is one less on greener renewable schemes, he said.
""Wales has done really well at this COP,"" said Dr Jen Allen of Cardiff University, a leading expert on international climate negotiations.
She was referring to the Welsh government's meetings with other nations around the world that ""share similar values, similar challenges - there's been a tonne of outreach"".
But also being the only part of the UK to sign up to a new alliance of nations committed to phasing out oil and gas felt like a particular moment.
""It puts Wales on the map as one of the leading nations that are saying 'look, we need to move past fossil fuels and we're going to start thinking in a serious way about how we do that',"" Dr Allen explained.
After rows back at home during the conference about the cancellation of road building schemes to cut emissions, Mr Waters said he'd take ""courage"" from COP26 not to be put off by people ""not willing to change"".
Difficult choices are needed, he said, because the science on global warming is ""clear and terrifying"".
The UK government - hosts of COP26 - will also be pleased with how the gigantic and long-planned-for event has panned out.
They'd made a push to involve all the UK nations - with nods to Wales including the naming of one of the main conference halls where the world leaders sat as Pen y Fan, after the mountain in the Brecon Beacons.
In fact, the summit felt at times like a bit of an uphill struggle.
However, it remains to be seen whether the pledges made are enough to help conquer climate change.

Around 40,000 people from around the world are estimated to have attended the UN's climate summit which attracted days of protests across Glasgow, as well as multiple celebrity appearances.
Here are some of the stand out moments.
More on the climate summit:
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

162,COP26,Jonathan Josephs,Delta boss says climate change means flying will cost more,2021-11-14,"The boss of the world's second biggest airline has said that tackling climate change will make flying more expensive.
""Over time, it's going to cost us all more, but it's the right approach that we must take,"" Delta Air Lines chief executive Ed Bastian told the BBC.
Aviation is responsible for about 2.5% of the carbon emissions that are warming the planet, according to the International Energy Agency.
Critics argue the best way to reduce them is by flying less.
Atlanta-based Delta says that after spending $30m (Â£22.4m) a year on carbon-offsetting it has been carbon neutral since March 2020.
It has also pledged to spend $1bn over the next decade to cancel out all the emissions it creates.
More fuel-efficient planes, sustainable aviation fuels and removing carbon from the atmosphere are some of the ways it hopes to achieve this.
Reducing carbon emissions is crucial if the world is to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels as agreed in Paris in 2015, and has been the focus of the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow.
Andreas Schafer, professor of energy and transport at University College London, says it will ""cost trillions rather than billions of dollars"" to move the global aviation sector to net zero carbon emissions.
Preliminary results from his team's research suggest airfares would need to increase by 10%-20% to cover the costs. 
""In the short-term, government support will be needed with those costs as decarbonising aviation will be extremely challenging, and current efforts will need to be scaled up dramatically"", says Prof Schafer.
Mr Bastian concedes it is an ambitious goal that his airline won't be able to achieve alone.
""It's the biggest long-term challenge this industry faces,"" he said. ""We're in an industry that's classified as hard to decarbonise because we don't have the bio-fuels or the sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) en masse yet that we're going to need."" 
Delta aims to be using 10% sustainable aviation fuel by the end of 2030. 
Many airlines and fuel companies are investing in SAFs. Other technologies being developed involve turning food waste into jet fuel and using carbon dioxide pulled out of the air.
However, these still cost more than traditional jet fuels and the quantities needed are also seen as problematic. 
According to the US government, global demand for jet fuel is set to more than double by 2050 . 
The number of passenger flights is set to jump from a pre-pandemic 4.5 billion to 10 billion by 2050, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). 
IATA director general Willie Walsh told the BBC that while creating the levels of SAF production needed was a big challenge, ""it is perfectly possible if industry and governments work together"". 
""Production increases will bring the cost down to competitive levels. We've seen similar increases in the development of solar and wind power in recent decades.""
At the UN climate change summit in Glasgow, 23 countries have pledged to work together to get the aviation industry to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.  More efficient energy use, sustainable aviation fuels and electric aeroplanes are all part of their ambitions. 
However, environmental campaign group Greenpeace says the agreement is ""brazen greenwashing"". 
""This announcement is full of scams like offsetting, and excessive optimism on so-called 'sustainable aviation fuels' and future aircraft designs,"" says Greenpeace's Klara Maria Schenk.
""But it lacks the one thing that's needed to deliver the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C which is tangible action to prioritise green travel and reduce flights.""
This video can not be played
Whilst many businesses and individuals have used the pandemic as a chance to re-evaluate their carbon footprints, Mr Bastian thinks the number of flights will return to pre-pandemic levels.
""All forms of travel are on the way back. Families are the part of the travelling public that we're most happy to see, because there's been some really difficult stories over time of families not being able to connect for long [periods]"". 
Business travel is also returning because video meetings can't replace everything, says Mr Bastian.
""There's a real unity and sense of purpose that we have when people get back together in person"".
That desire to travel helped Delta to report a $194m profit in the three months to the end of September, its first profit since the pandemic began.
Before the pandemic Delta was the world's second biggest airline, flying 200 million passengers in 2019. As of September it was operating at 71% of its pre-pandemic capacity.
The recovery in its domestic US market has been fastest, with long-haul routes to Asia the slowest. That echoes the pattern seen in a recent forecast from planemaker Boeing, which forecast a full recovery of global aviation would take until 2024.
Like other airlines, Delta has received billions in government support to get through the pandemic, but is hopeful of a brighter future now the US has reopened its borders to international travellers. 
This video can not be played
Mr Bastian says this may take some adjusting to and there may be long queues at airports as Covid vaccines and paperwork are checked.
However, he is confident in the airline's outlook and says the pandemic was ""an opportunity to invest in our future"".
Now the airline is making money again he says: ""We hope to be able to maintain that and go into the new year as a profitable carrier.""

163,COP26,Georgina Rannard,COP26 climate deal: 'It won't save us from drowning',2021-11-14,"The climate deal struck in Glasgow plans to reduce the world's reliance on coal and promises more money to help poorer countries cope with the impacts of a warming planet. 
Campaigners on the frontline of climate change have been speaking to the BBC what that means for them.
Largely pessimistic about the outcome of the summit, they passionately explained their fears that political agreements aren't enough to save their homes and cultures.
Elizabeth KitÃ© is an youth leader in Nuku'alofa, Tonga. The deal doesn't do enough to save her home in the Pacific islands from drowning, she says. The survival of their island is at stake.
She calls the summit a stage for big countries to ""flex how much they can pay small nations"". She wanted to hear rich countries acknowledge responsibility for historic greenhouse gas emissions. ""But they talk like promising money is a favour for us -  it is not,"" she says.
She became emotional when she was describing how proud she was to watch Pacific Island negotiators fight hard at the summit. Last week Foreign Minister Simon Kofe of Tuvalu gave a press conference standing in the sea, to highlight rising sea levels. 
""We are friendly people and usually very peaceful. It's unnatural for us to come out so strong - and I'm sad the deal doesn't reflect how hard we tried,"" she explains.
She is frustrated by what she feels is a lack of urgency and immediate actions: ""It's like rich countries are saying, 'Yes we'll let the islands die off and we'll try to figure something out along the way.'""
But she sees signs of progress. It's the first time fossil fuel and coal have been included in the texts. And she says the agreement to discuss separate funding for loss and damage - money to help countries pay for the damage caused by climate change they can't adapt to - is another positive step.
Sohanur Rahman, 25, is a founding member of Bangladesh's Friday for Future movement. He leads young people as they grow up in a low-lying country that is extremely vulnerable to climate change and feeling the dire effects now.
As the agreement was gavelled, he said he felt that youth were recognised for the first time at COP. But he concluded ""the end result is nothing"".
He was in Glasgow for two weeks and hoped to take back good news to the most affected communities. But he's leaving with feelings of helplessness and betrayal.
""These empty pledges will not protect our people from crisis,"" he explains.
He welcomes the news on loss and damage, but he says the voices of the most affected people were silenced. He blames the fossil fuel industry representatives at the summit.
Children in Bangladesh will still be forced out of education and communities will be displaced by rising sea levels, he fears.
Edwin Mumbere in Uganda lives in the shadow of the Rwenzori mountains where glacial melt and flooding is putting rural communities at huge risk. Now 29, he became an activist when he saw the snow disappearing from the high ground. 
He works with communities to bring solar power to the area and educates them about their rights as a pipeline is built nearby.
He calls the Glasgow deal disappointing for Uganda and thinks it makes no real difference to the 100,000 people in his communities.
""Real solutions have not been put in place despite us proving to them that climate change is real,"" he says.
His main concern is the lack of urgency in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. He sees new oil and gas exploration being established in Uganda and other parts of Africa and says that the Glasgow agreement won't stop that.
""Pledges to give money are being made and the same countries are also investing in projects that are seriously increasing the carbon emissions - it's truly a double standard,"" he says.
Jon Bonifacio, 23, studied biology before he became an activist in Metro Manila, Philippines. ""It's a lot of 'one step forward, two steps backwards'"", he said about the deal.
With 197 parties to the UN summit, compromise between countries with vastly different priorities is the route to agreement. But he says this compromise is ""completely unjust"" for countries on the climate frontline. ""We will continue to experience the climate crisis acutely and in the long term,"" he says.
He is distrustful of the language used in the text about coal and fossil fuels because he thinks it provides get-out clauses to the biggest polluters. 
Like many activists who have long campaigned for better support for developing nations, he says the promise to increase the money given to poorer countries represents good progress. 
He'll go back to Manila and keep fighting for change: ""Even if it was a perfect agreement, it's still up to citizens and activists to pressure their governments into action,"" he says.

But he faced late objections from India and others to a clause on cutting fossil fuels, and calls for more financial help for developing nations.
It's still not clear what needs to happen for these issues to be resolved.
""You all know that the world is willing us on to be bold - to be ambitious"" said the UK's Alok Sharma, who is chairing the talks. 
""So much rests on the decisions we collectively take today,"" he told delegates, urging them to get on board with the draft plan published earlier on Saturday.
The key achievements of the draft so far are the inclusion of a commitment to phase-out coal, re-visiting emissions-cutting plans on a more regular basis and increased financial help for developing countries.
But India's environment minister Bhupender Yadav told the meeting that ""consensus remains elusive"".
In an apparent reference to coal, he said: ""Targeting any particular sector is uncalled for. Every country will arrive at net zero as per its national circumstances.""
""Developing countries have a right to their fair share of the global carbon budget and are entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels,"" he added.
He also objected to proposals to end ""inefficient fossil fuel subsidies"" - financial benefits provided to producers of oil, gas and coal.
China, which is understood to have earlier raised concerns about the wording, said it hoped that ""all parties will show excellent flexibility"" and said it now wanted only small edits to the text.
South Africa's negotiator backed objections over the section on fossil fuels saying: ""We don't feel that one size fits all is a good approach."" 
But Mr Sharma said the text was a ""balanced package"".
US climate envoy John Kerry said: ""If it's a good negotiation all the parties are uncomfortable. And this, I think, has been a good negotiation.""
Lia Nicholson, from Antigua and Barbuda's delegation, and speaking on behalf of small island states, said they were ""extremely disappointed"" by the lack of progress on loss and damage - the principle that richer countries, which bear the main responsibility for the global warming, should pay compensation to poorer ones because of climate impacts.
She said: ""We will express our grievances in due course,"" but added: ""We implore all parties to support our common outcome and move forward.""
Promises in Glasgow will not be enough to limit global warming to 1.5C. It is a key part of the 2015 Paris agreement that most countries signed up to.
Scientists say that limiting temperature rise to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels will protect us from the most dangerous impacts of climate change. 
Meeting the goal requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030 and to zero overall by 2050. One example of the impact of global temperature rise above 2C is the death of virtually all tropical coral reefs, scientists say.
One estimate by the Climate Action Tracker calculated that the planet is still set to warm by 2.4C if the current pledges are all met. 
At COPs, it often all comes down to a huddle. Inside the main Plenary Room, the days of negotiations turn into a face-to-face discussion, like merchants in a souk. 
Around them, delegates cluster, keen to be there at the moment when key differences between the groups or countries are resolved. 
This afternoon, US climate envoy John Kerry and chief US negotiator Sue Biniaz stood toe-to-toe with Ahmadou Sebory Toure, the delegate from Guinea, who also represents the G77 group of nations, a large part of the developing world. 
At stake, how much money the developed world may have to pay to the developing world to compensate for the loss and damage done to developing countries because of climate change. 
Interest in that ends when Mr Kerry sweeps across the room to talk to the UK President of the COP, Alok Sharma and his chief negotiator, Archie Young. 
Then, all eyes move to the EU's chief negotiator, Frans Timmermans, as his team work out the repercussions of the G77 huddle. 
Eventually, the COP chairman decides enough is enough and further discussions must take place elsewhere. The session ends and so do the huddles. For now.
But experts say the 1.5C target is still achievable: at COP15 in Copenhagen more than a decade ago, estimates suggested the world was heading for between 3.5 and 4.2C of warming.
If the references to phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies remain in the final deal, it would be an historic moment in climate negotiations.
Gabriela Bucher, Oxfam's international executive director, said: ""Clearly some world leaders think they aren't living on the same planet as the rest of us. It seems no amount of fires, rising sea levels or droughts will bring them to their senses to stop increasing emissions at the expense of humanity. 
""The world's poorest have done the least to cause the climate emergency, yet are the ones left struggling to survive while also footing the bill.
Climate finance, or the money promised by richer countries to poorer countries to fight climate change, continues to be one of the most contentious points. In 2009, developed nations pledged to provide $100bn per year to emerging economies by 2020. But this target was not met.

167,COP26,BBC News,Arrest after protester stops Drax power station train,2021-11-13,"A protester has been arrested after climbing on top of a train near a power plant in North Yorkshire.
The Axe Drax campaign group said one of its activists ""halted the train"", which was carrying wood pellets and heading to Drax Power station near Selby. 
British Transport Police (BTP) said a 57-year-old woman from Leicester was arrested for endangering safety on the railway. 
Drax said there had been ""no impact"" on its operation.
BTP said it was called to the scene at just before 16:00 GMT on Friday ""to reports of a trespasser who had flagged down a freight train"". The fire service was called and the woman was arrested at 10:50 GMT.
""Everyone has the right to peaceful protest but trespassing on railway lines and obstructing trains puts the safety of themselves and others in danger,"" the force said.
Axe Drax said the protest was against the felling of trees which are used to make biomass pellets.
It claims the pellets ""harm both people and planet"", and linked deforestation to ""an increase in flooding, soil degradation, biodiversity and habitat loss, noise and air pollution for local communities"". 
The organisation added that the demonstration was being carried out ""to send a clear message to COP26 - stop the fell"". 
Images on social media show the activist, dressed in orange, waving a flag bearing the Extinction Rebellion logo. It comes as the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow draws to an end.
A Drax spokesperson said it supported peaceful protest but trespassing on railway lines ""puts the safety of train staff, as well as the protesters themselves, at risk.""
The company said the power station had ""slashed [its] emissions from power generation by 90%"" since converting from using coal to ""sustainable biomass"".
It added Drax was ""helping the UK's electricity system to decarbonise faster than any other major economy"".

169,COP26,BBC News,Climate change: The everyday actions that can help save the planet,2021-11-13,"It's not only the decisions of world leaders at climate summits that have an impact on our planet.
Talk about carbon off-setting and net-zero can sometimes feel quite distant, or hard to relate to. 
While policy changes are required to meet our planet's climate goals set out at the COP26 summit, it's not the whole picture. 
People across Wales are doing their bit every day to help reduce their impact on the planet.
Charles Swanborough, 69, from Flintshire, is a van driver and tries his best to limit his impact on the planet by adjusting his driving style. 
""It's actually quite difficult because we do long journeys, but the biggest thing you can do is drive sedately,"" he said.
""It's about top speed, the difference in fuel consumption between 55 and 75 [mph] is actually quite small, it's about how you get to that speed.""
Charles said that driving carefully, and not accelerating hard, greatly reduced fuel consumption and his impact on the climate.
From avoiding buying plastic wherever possible, driving as little as she can, putting layers on when it gets cold, Lesley Sweet said she'd been committed to lessening her impact on the world for most of her life. 
""I'm 62 and I've been thinking about this since I was a teenager,"" said Lesley, from Llanfyllin in Powys.
She thinks one of the biggest obstacles in the fight against climate change is ""convenience"".
""No one wants to change anything they do if it's inconvenient. 'It's inconvenient for me to put more clothes on' or 'it's inconvenient for me to not have a patio heater because I want to sit on the patio when it's cold'.
""They want climate change to be solved without inconvenience and without hardship, and it has to be inconvenient and it has to be hard.""

Bethan Hughes, from Pwllheli in Gwynedd, often litter picks on her local beaches. She thinks it's important that every person does the little they are able to - ""because otherwise what's the point?""
""I go locally to beaches and collect the refuse from there, if everyone did little bits it all helps, because we can't do the big bits can we?
""I don't understand why people leave litter on beaches, so it's just the little bit that I can do to help.
""The governments etc, they're just going to do with big things aren't they?So we have to do the little bits and bobs that we can."" 
Cathy Elder, 60, from Cardiff, has signed up for a group that helps clean up local rivers. 
""I think it's a really good thing to go and do and get involved in,"" she said. 
""We've all got to do our own little bit, we've all got to do things in our local communities.""
She believed everyone had an individual responsibility to help out where they could, but it had to be backed up by the decisions made by politicians. 
""The politicians and the businesses have all got to really step up big time so that what we're doing as individuals is worth it.""
Gary Beer, 63, from Bryn in Port Talbot, has installed solar panels on the roof of his home, and thinks more needs to be done to make them available to everyone. 
""Why don't they put solar power on everyone's roof? I know we don't have constant sun but having it seven or eight years myself I know how much energy you can save.
""Solar power, even in our climate, would make a great reduction for saving power to help towards the climate.""

Oadby and Wigston Council said it planned to give away the trees as part of National Tree Week, to encourage people to have a positive impact on the environment.
One resident said she hoped to increase the variety of trees in her garden.
Councillor David Carter said he hoped the scheme would help get people thinking about climate change.
Razan Salameh, one of the first residents to apply for a tree, said: ""I was interested to apply as I have a big garden and I am always keen to add to the variety of trees I've got.
""I'm hoping to collect [the trees] next week.""
Mr Carter, who chairs the council's environment working group, said: ""We wanted to encourage families and organisations in the borough to think about climate change and carbon emissions.
""We recognise free trees won't solve the problem but they start the conversation.""
The council said each household and community organisation in the borough can apply for up to two trees via email.
The trees include locally grown native varieties such as hawthorn, spindle, hazel, holly and dog rose and will be available from 27 November, which coincides with National Tree Week.
Collections will be from Brocks Hill Country Park in Oadby.

174,COP26,BBC News,COP26: Hopes of Glasgow climate agreement on Saturday,2021-11-12,"Alok Sharma is hopeful a climate agreement can be reached at Glasgow's COP26 on Saturday.
The summit president said that a revised text would be released by about 08:00 with the aim to finish negotiations by ""Saturday pm"".
Negotiators talked through the night on Thursday with a new draft deal produced on Friday morning
Mr Sharma called on countries for a ""final injection of that can-do spirit"" to get a deal over the line.
The climate talks had been due to end at 18:00. 
Nicola Sturgeon said on Friday evening that she was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the outcome and that there were signs a deal was ""inching forward"" in the right direction as negotiations moved beyond the deadline. 
She told COP26 leaders ""don't fail"" and said she wanted negotiators to be able to ""look the next generation in the eye"" with an agreement that would increase global temperatures by no more than 1.5C and urged them not to leave until a good deal had been achieved.
The first minister said there had been ""big concessions"", including from the United States on adaptation funding for developing countries. 
She told BBC Scotland the final agreement would depend on the political will, determination and leadership that is shown in the hours ahead. 
On the last scheduled day of the 13-day summit, hundreds of delegates walked out of COP26 to join a protest outside the UN blue zone.
Activists took to the stage to express frustration at a lack of results.
Members of environmental groups and trade unions were among those who sang ""power to the people"" as they left the arena to join hundreds of protesters in the street outside the blue zone.
The latest draft agreement has watered-down commitments to end the use of coal and other fossil fuels.
While the language around fossil fuels has been softened, the inclusion of the commitment in a final deal would be seen as a landmark moment.
Protests, however, took place throughout the day with campaigners claiming the summit was falling far short of what is required. 
Following a ""People's Plenary"" session in one of the main halls organised by the Cop26 Coalition, activists from around the world marched through the venue with a group of indigenous activists leading the procession.
They carried banners and red ribbons to represent the red lines crossed by negotiators.
At a rally next to the COP26 venue, campaigners gathered for a street disco which turned sombre as speakers who came from inside the blue zone addressed the crowd. 
One of the speakers, a 15-year-old from Chad, told how Lake Chad has dried up by 95% since the 1950s. 
But despite being accredited for the summit the teenager said she has been excluded from key meetings. 
She added: ""No one is listening. No one is doing anything.""
Another speaker alluded to the weather and praised those who have braved the wet conditions.  
She told the audience: ""I hope you leave drenched in hope.""
Sarah, 29, an Extinction Rebellion activist from Glasgow, was helping to hold up sign outside the UN blue zone which read: ""A Giant COP Up"". 
She told the BBC: ""We are here today because COP has failed. 
""COP has essentially been a giant trade show in which the fossil fuel executives have a bigger presence than delegates from countries most affected by climate change. 
""It has shown that leaders, such as our own government, are content to let people suffer and let people die rather than take the action that is required.""
Sarah said solutions to the climate crisis lie outside the barricaded SEC and on the streets, where some of the most affected groups had gathered to make their voice heard.
The atmosphere outside the UN blue zone was good natured, with activists even taking part in a mass Macarena dance.
Around midday they were joined by delegates who filed out of the Scottish Event Campus.
The rally that followed featured contributions from a diverse range of international speakers and a common theme - politicians are not doing enough to address the climate crisis.
The event was on a much smaller scale than the colourful protests which snaked through the city last Friday and Saturday.
But shortly after 14:15, as I was taking pictures of the distinctive Extinction Rebellion red dancers, I heard a commotion to my left. 
I looked round to see a man attempting to scale the barrier.
He was immediately grabbed by three police officers and pinned to the ground. 
Seconds later, a few yards away, another protestor took advantage of the chaos and also tried to climb over the fence. He got his right leg over it before he was also hauled onto the road.
Dr Caroline Palmer travelled to Glasgow for the day from Colne, Lancashire, with her husband Malcolm Redford.
The retired GP, 67, said: ""I have got grandchildren and I feel very worried about what life is going to be like for them. It is our duty to do what we can to hold our government to account.
""They keep making promises but what we need is action. It's getting critical now.""
Mr Redford, 68, wants to see an end to the extraction of fossil fuels and more affordable electric cars.
The former teacher said: ""We need to make real choices to keep 1.5 alive otherwise we have lost.""
Nayara Castiglioni Amaral has been in Scotland for the last fortnight as part of a delegation from a Brazilian youth organisation.
Carrying a cardboard cut-out of the country's environment minister she expressed concern about the impact of her government's policy on indigenous communities.
The 29-year-old said: ""We need more ambitious goals and we need to protect our tribal people as they take care of our environment.""
Nayara said one of the highlights of her trip was last Saturday's march which organisers say attracted 100,000 people. 
She added: ""It was one of the biggest protests that we have ever seen and it was beautiful. It was really powerful to be there.""

While the draft agreement has been watered down in its wording, vulnerable nations are still hopeful the final text that gets over the line will be clearer, firmer and definite in its stated aims.  
The feeling is that, overall, this has been a positive COP - but the final say on how it will be remembered will be reserved for when the ink begins to dry on the paper.

177,Climate change,BBC News,Climate change: Do I need to stop eating meat?,2021-11-12,"Almost a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from agriculture and other related land use, according to the United Nations.
With livestock being one of the main contributors, the government's climate advisers have said the public should be urged to less meat to help protect the planet. 
Meat consumption in the UK dropped by 17% in the decade to 2019, with the average daily amount eaten per person falling from from 3.6oz (103g) to 3oz.
But while most people are eating less red and processed meat compared to a decade ago, they are eating more white meat, according to a study published in Lancet Planetary Health.
More than one billion chickens and other poultry were killed for food in the UK in 2018.
The impact of livestock on emissions varies between countries. Globally, the UN estimates it makes up more than 14% of all man-made greenhouse gases, including methane.
When we talk about emissions, we usually think of carbon dioxide (CO2). But livestock's emissions also include methane, which is up to 34 times more damaging to the environment over 100 years than CO2, according to the UN.
Beef produces the most greenhouse gas emissions, which include methane. A global average of 110lb (50kg) of greenhouse gases is released per 3.5oz of protein.
Lamb has the next highest environmental footprint but these emissions are 50% less than beef. 
Cattle produce more methane than poultry, which rely more on imported feed than cows, generating a carbon footprint offshore, says Prof Margaret Gill, from University of Aberdeen.
Measuring and comparing the environmental impact of different foods is not simple. 
This is partly because some measurements include emissions from processing, packaging and transportation, rather than just the farming process.
The diagram below is based on research published in the Science journal, which estimated emissions per serving of different foods. It shows a wide range of potential environmental impact, even within the same foods, depending on how and where they are produced. 
According to the UK's Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, greenhouse gas emissions are lower from UK-produced beef, partly because the ""landscape and climate is perfect for growing grass, with grasslands covering 65% of our farmland and 50% of total land"". This means cows don't rely as much on grain and other feed, which can have a high carbon footprint.
Other factors around the world vary the environmental impact. Beef production is the leading cause of deforestation in tropical rainforests such as the Amazon, says food sustainability researcher Valentina Caldart. This adds to the environmental impact of beef from that part of the world.
The true climate impact of what we eat is not easy to calculate, says Prof Gill. ""Carbon footprints of food vary with how it is produced and where it comes from, and thus changes with the seasons,"" she says. 
So, as well as cutting down on red meat and dairy, people who want to make their diets more climate-friendly can follow principles including minimising waste and trying to choose fruit and vegetables that are in season. 
Prof Gill says there is: ""A need for transition - albeit fairly rapid - rather than abrupt change.""
Many people wanting to reduce the environmental impact of their diets have cut out animal products such as milk and cheese. According to the Vegan Society, there were 600,000 vegans in the UK in 2018.
The biggest environmental impact of non-meat products comes from land use change, the effect on soil quality and things like transport and packaging.
Non-animal protein generally emits much less greenhouse gases than meat and dairy.
""Replacing beef with pork may sound like a good choice,"" says Ms Caldart. ""But opting for peas instead would be even better: their production results in 90% less emissions."" 
How we produce our food does not just affect our global emissions, but has a wider environmental impact, such as on biodiversity.
""We live on a planet where nature is being squeezed out"" says Mike Barrett, executive director of science and conservation at the World Wildlife Fund.
""Half of all habitable land is used for agriculture, and three-quarters of that land is used to feed and raise livestock.""
Mr Barrett says: ""To feed a growing world population, it's far more efficient to use land to produce crops that people can consume directly, and to have a fair global approach ensuring that parts of the world with diets high in meat and dairy shift towards more plant-based foods.""
Adopting a ""flexitarian"" diet would also allow us to move away from factory farming with its low animal welfare standards, says Peter Stevenson, chief policy adviser to the charity Compassion in World Farming.

178,Climate change,Rosalind Skillen,Peatlands: The race to protect NI's valuable ecosystems,2021-11-12,"Peatlands are regarded as among the most valuable ecosystems on the planet.
Not only do they support a range of specialised plants and animals, they also act as a major store of soil carbon. 
Restoring these areas can therefore play a vital role in helping to meet ambitious climate targets. 
About 18% of Northern Ireland is covered by peatland, with semi-natural peatland covering about 12%, according to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera). 
Conservation charity RSPBNI defines semi-natural peatland as having had some human intervention, such as drainage or grazing, yet is displaying some natural peatland characteristics.
The department says that even though semi-natural peatlands cover just 12% of land, they account for 53% of the soil carbon pool, highlighting their environmental importance.
The percentage cover of peatland on the island of Ireland is only exceeded in global terms by three countries - Finland, Canada and Indonesia, the department argues. 
As such, Ireland's peatland habitats ""are recognised as being important globally, nationally and locally"". 
Daera recently ran a 12-week public consultation into its Peatlands Strategy, which will provide a framework for conserving and restoring semi-natural peatlands. 
It sets out the actions the department considers necessary to ensure that they can survive as functioning ecosystems.  
These include:
Peatlands are a type of wetland found in almost every country, from blanket bogs in the UK to swamp forests in Southeast Asia.
The term peatlands refers to the peat soil and the wetland habitat around it.
Peat forms over the course of millions of years as waterlogged conditions slow the process of plant decomposition.
Projects are already taking place in Northern Ireland to help these restoration efforts. 
Environment Minister Edwin Poots, launching the consultation in June, visited the Cuilcagh Mountain Special Area of Conservation in County Fermanagh. 
Local landowners and Ulster Wildlife are working together with others through the Collaborative Action for the Natural Network (CANN) project, supported by â¬9.4m (Â£8m) in EU money, to restore precious peatland habitat on the mountain. 
The project has already begun to carry out large scale restoration works at several sites.
At the COP26 climate gathering in Glasgow, Mr Poots said restoring peatlands would play a key role in plans to reduce carbon emissions and lead to a low carbon, high nature future, as envisaged in the Northern Ireland's Executive's draft Green Growth Strategy, released in October. 
Scientists say it is more important than ever that we restore and safeguard these boggy landscapes.
A 2019 study found that Europe's peatlands are in such a dry and fragile state, they could go into reverse, releasing rather than absorbing carbon.
Researchers examined 31 peatlands across England, Ireland, Scandinavia and continental Europe to assess changes during the last 2,000 years.
Dr Jonathan Bell, head of land and sea policy at RSPBNI, says damaged peatlands become a carbon source rather than carbon sink.
""It means that they emit carbon rather than storing it safely in the ground,"" he says. 
""The poor condition of peatlands in Northern Ireland means that they are estimated to contribute between 6-8% to Northern Ireland emissions.""
Mr Bell argues that burning peat for fuel, which would historically have been common in many rural areas, is damaging to the environment, as it converts it into carbon dioxide.
Graeme Swindles, professor of geography at the School of Natural and Built Environment, Queen's University Belfast, argues that ""healthy peatlands could have a hugely positive impact on our climate targets"". 
""An ambitious programme to restore the peatlands can accelerate our pursuit to reach the UK target of net zero emissions by 2050, while helping us to meet our biodiversity targets"" he says. 
Prof Swindles says peatlands are important habitats where small animals, birds, and invertebrates can re-colonise. In doing so, they foster the growth of diverse flora including sphagnum mosses, sedges, and heathers.
They provide what Prof Swindles describes as ""pockets of wilderness in our landscape for both plants and animals to thrive"".
A project in the Garron Plateau in County Antrim, the largest area of blanket bog in Northern Ireland, carried out by Daera, NI Water, and RSPBNI, revealed how peatland restoration can also offer multiple economic benefits that often go unacknowledged. 
An RSPBNI study, Valuing our Peatlands, found that there would be financial benefit if the whole of the Garron Plateau was restored by 2045.
The study found that it could stimulate the economy by providing a range of green jobs, helping to increase employment. 
Ambitious peatland programmes could play an important role in mapping a transition for Northern Ireland. 
Nigel McLaughlin, of the Irish Farmers' Association's Hill Farming Committee, which represents 20,000 hill farmers, says farmers have accumulated years of ""multi-generational expertise on peatlands"".
He says they are therefore best placed to manage these habitats. 
He stresses ""a need to continue to collect agri-data and carbon measurements"", and states that ""the farming community should be involved in every aspect of the decision-making process"".

181,COP26,Georgina Rannard,COP26: Coal compromise as leaders near climate deal,2021-11-12,"A draft agreement at the COP26 climate summit has watered down commitments to end the use of coal and other fossil fuels, as countries race to reach a deal after two weeks of talks. 
While the language around fossil fuels has been softened, the inclusion of the commitment in a final deal would be seen as a landmark moment.
A deal must be agreed by the end of the summit, which is in its final hours.
The UN meeting is seen as crucial for limiting the effects of global warming.
The draft agreement, which was published early on Friday following all-night talks, also asks for much tighter deadlines for governments to reveal their plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
And it also strengthens support for poorer countries fighting climate change.
Negotiations over a final deal could stretch late into Friday, or potentially even longer.
""This text is the bare minimum. The next few hours are going to determine the new dawn,"" says Simon Stiell, climate resilience minister for Grenada, a small island that is highly vulnerable to climate change.
""If the text withstands the battering it may get, we are holding onto 1.5C by our fingernails,"" he says, referring to the ambition to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C degrees to avoid the worst effects of climate change.
Negotiators from countries that depend on fossil fuels may still attempt to amend the text before the summit ends.
Climate groups cautiously welcomed signs of progress in the draft but said there is a long way to go yet.
""The key line on phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies has been critically weakened, but it's still there and needs to be strengthened again before this summit closes,"" says Jennifer Morgan of Greenpeace International.
""But there's wording in here worth holding on to and the UK presidency needs to fight tooth and nail to keep the most ambitious elements in the deal,"" she says.
Prof Jim Watson at University College London said the draft agreement had encouraging elements, but that overall it was ""nowhere near ambitious enough"". 
The draft comes after UN chief AntÃ³nio Guterres warned that COP26 would probably not achieve its aims and the crucial goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C is on ""life support"".
Limiting warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels is a key part of the Paris agreement that most countries signed up to. It requires cutting global emissions by 45% by 2030 and to zero overall by 2050.
One example of the impact of global temperature rise above 2C is the death of virtually all coral reefs, scientists say.
A previous version of the agreement called upon parties to ""accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels"".
This has been changed to call for ""accelerating the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels"".
Unabated coal is coal produced without the use of technology to capture the emitted carbon.
But the draft requests that countries submit their plans - known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change by next year's climate summit. Previous agreements asked countries to submit these NDCs every five years.
This latest draft of the decision has gained in strength in many areas - but as in every negotiation, there are some losses too.
One small but important change is in relation to 1.5C - the text formerly said that the world should aim to keep global temperatures under this threshold ""by 2100"".
Some scientists for the IPCC [the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] saw this as allowing temperatures to go well beyond 1.5 as long as they were brought back down by the end of the century. This has been changed to simply say ""limiting temperatures to 1.5C.""
The commitment of countries to come back next year with a new carbon-cutting plan is still in the draft, although the language around it has been softened. 
Perhaps of greater concern though is the inclusion of the phrase ""taking into account different national circumstances"". 
While this is being seen as a way of allowing vulnerable states and other low-emitting countries to avoid having to update their plans, could it also be used by China to do the same thing?
Where the new document really gains strength is in relation to finance and loss and damage, two key issues for developing nations.
Money for adapting to the worst impacts of climate change will be doubled, and the baseline year will be 2021. 
This is a first step on a road that will please the most vulnerable nations.
A key sticking point at COP26 is climate finance - the money promised by richer countries to poorer countries to fight climate change. It is controversial because developed countries are responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions, but developing countries see the worst effects of climate change.
Despite the promises made at COP26 so far, the planet is still heading for 2.4C of warming above pre-industrial levels, according to a report by Climate Action Tracker.

184,COP26,Sabrina Lee & Geraint Thomas,Climate change: Size of Wales may change due to coastal erosion,2021-11-12,"The size of Wales is a common unit of measurement - but the country's outline could slightly change over the next century due to climate change.
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said protecting all areas was ""difficult against the forces of nature"".
More than 71,000 properties are currently at risk of flooding in Wales from tidal sources, the environment body added.
NRW has said coastal flooding and erosion is ""a big risk for Wales"".
Jeremy Parr, its head of flood and incident risk management, said in decades to come there will be ""some tough decisions in some locations where we might need to relocate some small communities and certainly make space for water and look after our environment.""
Wales has 1,680 miles of coastline which surrounds the country on three sides, and about 60% of the Welsh population live in coastal areas.
Mr Parr said coastal flooding and erosion would be ""a big risk for Wales"" and ""all indications are it's going to get worse.""
""We can expect sea level rise for one thing and some of the predictions around that are quite scary,"" he added.
""The coastline is a dynamic environment. Parts of the coast will erode and fall away into the sea.""
This video can not be played
""You get increased storminess and increase in winds. That can increase the water level even further and make conditions along the coast, really, really treacherous - and it means that there will be more flooding and it means that there will be more erosion.""
People are able to check the long term flood risk of their area or street online.
The warning follows a major landslide on the north Wales coastline earlier this year when cliffs of about 40m (131ft) wide fell onto a beach at Nefyn in Gwynedd.
NRW said it ""makes sense"" to protect some vulnerable coastal towns and areas that are home to Wales' key infrastructure - like major roads and railways - and heritage sites such as castles.

The environmental watchdog has been working with local authorities and the Welsh government for several years to develop shoreline management plans for areas where climate change posed a particular challenge.
But NRW acknowledges that losing areas of land to the seas was a difficult topic and needed to be handled sensitively so that people were not frightened.
As the COP26 climate summit draws to a close in Glasgow, the Royal Meteorological Society said cases of such extreme weather were on the increase, and global warming had serious implications.
""The Royal Met Society has been around since 1850 and we've seen a lot of extreme events here in the UK over that time,"" said chief executive Liz Bentley.
This video can not be played
""But what we're finding because of climate change is that those events are becoming more frequent.
""One degree has made a big shift in what we're seeing in rainfall patterns. It also means we've started to see a significant increase in sea levels. So the sea level has risen by about 16 centimetres, which again, doesn't sound very much, but for low-lying areas that has a huge impact.""
One leading geographical professor said Wales' coastline would ""change a lot"" in low lying areas with the sea moving inland.
""On the higher elevation areas there won't be that much change but there will be cliff falls,"" said Prof Richard Lucas, from Aberystwyth University's geography and earth sciences department.
He said that although the landscape had changed in the past, the pace of change was a new phenomenon.
""It's the speed of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and the speed that sea levels and other factors like flooding are changing.
""So the sea level is rising more rapidly than in the past, and ecosystems and people have to respond to that. And sometimes it's just too fast for them."" 
He added that to avoid a change in the shape of Wales, sea defences would ""need to be strengthened into the future"". The situation ""depends on the actions of people and how we respond to changing climate.""

186,Climate change,Reality Check team,Climate change: What are the big polluters doing to cut carbon emissions?,2021-11-12,"Just four countries plus the European Union are responsible for most of the world's emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is the most common greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. 
All five signed up to the Paris agreement in 2015 to cut emissions to limit global temperature rises. 
What steps have they taken since? 
Carbon neutrality refers to the balancing of overall carbon emissions with measures to absorb it from the atmosphere such as the planting of trees.
China is the largest producer of CO2, and its carbon emissions are still rising, largely because of a reliance on coal.
Last month, President Xi Jinping announced it would stop funding new coal-fired projects overseas.  
But at home, coal mines have been ordered to ramp up production to meet surging energy demand, although Beijing has promised to cut back on coal use from 2026. 
China now accounts for more than a third of all global solar power and is the world's biggest producer of wind energy.
But it needs to cut demand for coal by more than 80% by 2060 to meet its climate goals, according to the International Energy Agency. 
Climate Action Tracker says it's not clear if its net zero plan is for just CO2 or all greenhouse gases. 
And it rates its policies and actions as ""insufficient,"" and not consistent with the Paris Agreement goal of keeping to a 1.5C increase in global temperatures.
China has not joined a pledge made at the climate summit by more than 100 countries to reduce emissions of another greenhouse gas, methane, by 30% by 2030.  
However, in a joint action plan with the United States, China has promised to develop a ""National Action Plan"" to address the issue of methane emissions.
More than 80% of US energy comes from fossil fuels, although renewable energy sources are on the increase.
President Joe Biden's environmental plan looks to expand green energy further, with a $150bn (Â£100bn) clean-electricity programme to reward utility companies switching from fossil fuels.
The US has also pledged ""100% carbon pollution-free"" electricity by 2035 - a commitment made in its joint statement with China at the COP26 summit.
CO2 emissions have been dropping over the past decade.
But Climate Action Tracker says US actions and policies are ""insufficient"", and need ""substantial improvement"" to be consistent with the Paris Agreement.
The top CO2 emitters in the EU are Germany, Italy and Poland.  
And while it has overall emissions targets, EU states have differing financial and technical capabilities.
But all member countries need to agree how they reach the bloc's targets, as the EU negotiates as a single entity when it comes to the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (Cop26).
Climate Action Tracker says its policies and actions are ""almost sufficient"" to keep the global temperature rise to less than 2C, noting emissions have been falling since 2018.
India's annual CO2 emissions have risen steadily in the past two decades - but it produces the lowest emissions per person among the top five.
India has argued the wealthier, more industrialised nations should bear more of the burden, as they have contributed far more to global warming over time.
It has a target for cutting ""emissions intensity"" - CO2 per unit of economic growth - saying this is a fairer way to compare with other countries. 
India has announced a target date for net zero of 2070 - later than other major emitters.
It has also promised a significant increase in energy production from non-fossil fuel sources such as wind, solar and hydro power - and by 2019, this had reached 23%.
But about 70% of India's electricity grid is powered by coal. And India has not joined the methane emissions reduction initiative unveiled at COP26.
Climate Action Tracker says the country needs to phase out coal power generation before 2040 and boost its target for energy derived from non-fossil fuels.
India is also a major methane emitter, but it has not joined the global pledge to cut emissions by 2030.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, in 1991, Russia's economy - and its carbon emissions - shrank anyway. 
But Russia is still relying on its extensive forests and swamps to absorb carbon.
Climate Action Tracker notes that for the COP26 conference, Russia had not updated its targets since the 2015 Paris Agreement.
Non-fossil fuel sources make up only a small proportion of its total energy mix. 
It's also a major emitter of methane, but has not joined in the emissions cut pledge made at the climate summit.

The COP26 global summit, in Glasgow, in November, is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions - and it could lead to major changes to everyday lives.

188,COP26,BBC News,"COP26: Fear of failure on final day, and just how green was summit?",2021-11-12,"Here are five things you need to know about the COP26 climate change conference on Friday.
As the UN's COP26 climate summit enters its final day, fears are growing it will not meet its goals. A final deal has been tabled in Glasgow but representatives must now discuss the details until all 197 countries agree. And UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres says governments are unlikely to make the pledges necessary to cut CO2 emissions by enough to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.  However, he told the Associated Press news agency hope remained ""until the last moment"".
The summit is scheduled to close at 18:00GMT, although negotiations could continue overnight.
While delegates work towards reducing carbon emissions, an initial assessment for the UK government suggests emissions from the summit itself are likely to reach the equivalent of 102,500 tonnes of carbon dioxide. That's similar to the annual emissions from about 10,000 UK households and double those from the last climate summit. The government points out more than 39,000 participants have been in Glasgow, against 27,000 in Madrid in 2019.
Wales joined a new global alliance of countries pledging to stop licensing oil and gas production, along with Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Greenland, the Republic of Ireland, Quebec, California and New Zealand - but not the rest of the UK. Meanwhile, representatives from Ghana, Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Tuvalu held a news conference claiming the US was blocking progress at COP26. They say the US is dismissing the financial concerns of the poorest and most vulnerable nations.
4. How will COP26 change our day-to-day lives?
While climate scientists and politicians wrestle with cutting carbon emissions in a bid to limit climate change, you could be forgiven for wondering about the impact of policies on daily life. ""How is the average family going to find the extra Â£20,000 needed to buy an electric vehicle?"" wonders Nicola Hippisley, of London. Our correspondent Chris Morris answers this - electric cars may soon be similarly priced to petrol or diesel models - and more of your questions. 
When Nandi Bushell, from Ipswich, penned a climate change song after learning about the subject in school, she couldn't have imagined it would end up being shared by Barack Obama. The 11-year-old had already performed with Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl after publicly challenging him to a ""drum off"". But she said it was ""incredible"" to have the former US president praise the song she wrote with Roman Morello, son of Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello.

There has been criticism of the number of people who have flown to the summit, including some in private jets. Aviation contributes about 2% of the world's global carbon emissions, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and it creates non-CO2 emissions at altitude, which have an additional warming effect. An economy-class return flight from London to New York emits an estimated 0.67 tonnes of CO2 per passenger. That's equivalent to 11% of the average annual emissions for someone in the UK, or about the same as those produced over a year by someone in Ghana.

189,COP26,Tom Airey,"COP26: Flooding lessons from Hull, a city below sea level",2021-11-12,"As COP26 ends and world leaders sign off on big picture promises, speakers from the city of Hull were among those having their say at the climate conference. One of several global cities deemed at severe risk from flooding, it was there to share the innovative measures it is using in the hope of keeping its head above water. 
Paul Tempest was among thousands of people who had to flee their homes when Hull was hit by almost biblical floods in 2007.
""We saw the water rising in the garden, then while trying to barricade the doors with sandbags the carpet in the hallway started to rise beneath your feet,"" he says.
""Water was coming through the air bricks, filling the void and the floorboards. Then everything started to rise.""
He was unable to return to his house in the Cottingham area for a year. Thankfully, his home has not been flooded since. But after a storm surge battered the city in 2013, the threat of further misery from rising water levels is an ever-present worry for many in Hull.
With its rich maritime history, water has been at the centre of Hull's lives and livelihoods for centuries. But it could equally pose the biggest threat to its existence - a fact the devastating flooding events in recent years has brought into sharp focus.
Home to about 260,000 people, Hull is second only to London in the rankings of UK cities deemed most vulnerable to flooding. Occupying the flat bottom of a low-lying land basin, about 90% of it sits below sea level at high tide, and just 2% is considered not to be at risk from flooding.
It is also surrounded by water. The River Hull snakes through its centre and out into the Humber Estuary - a shipping port and gateway to the nearby North Sea. On the government's National Risk Register, coastal flooding is second only to pandemics in terms of the ""high-consequence"" threats facing the country. 
""Hull floods in every way it is possible to flood, it's experienced all the different types,"" says Prof Dan Parsons, director of the Energy and Environment Institute at the University of Hull.
""The city sits below the high tide mark, so the city defences keep the tidal water away but it means any water that comes into the city has to be pumped out, including the rainfall and some of the river flows.""
Prof Parsons' assessment is not theoretical. Within the last 15 years the city has experienced two major floods that affected thousands of people and caused millions in damage.
The first came in 2007 during the UK's wettest summer on record. Surface water and river flooding affected more than 55,000 homes and businesses across the country. 
About one-fifth of those were in Hull.
Thousands were evacuated from their homes on 25 June when the city's drainage systems were overwhelmed by the deluge. Michael Barnett, 28, died from hypothermia after he became trapped in a storm drain. Nearly all of the city's 98 schools were damaged, with total flood repair costs across Hull put at more than Â£40m.
Six years later, in 2013, Hull was hit by a different type of flood, when a storm surge combined with high spring tides to create record water levels along coastlines and in tidal rivers. 
The 5 December surge caused 400 properties to flood, with the River Hull's tidal surge barrier - which prevents water moving upstream from the Humber Estuary - coming within 0.40m (1ft 4ins) of being overwhelmed. 
Something more needed to be done. Over the course of 10 years after the 2007 flood, ""different agencies spent hundreds of millions of pounds on pumping, drainage, flood defence,"" says Lee Pitcher, from the Living With Water partnership. But Hull remained the second most at-risk place in the country.
It became clear a significant change in the city's flood prevention priorities was needed. At a 2017 meeting inside Hull's aquarium, The Deep, which sits a stone's throw away from the tidal barrier, a new approach was agreed.
""It felt like this was the time to do something really different and radical,"" says Mr Pitcher, whose group was formed after the meeting by bringing together separate agencies responsible for water management in the city.
Hull joined a support network of five global cities directly affected by water, with the group helping to form a ""global standard"" for water resilience. Four years on, Mr Pitcher was on-stage at COP26 sharing the city's new approach with the world. 
It works in part by moving away from the grey infrastructure of human-engineered barriers to ""blue-green"" sustainable systems which often use natural drainage provided by green spaces. ""Aqua greens"" - natural water traps - have been created across the city, slowing the flow of surface water during downpours and relieving pressure on drainage systems. 
""It's OK that the park is flooded, because it's supposed to flood when it rains heavily and that's a good thing as it's no longer in your home,"" Prof Parsons says. According to Living With Water, Hull had the same amount of rainfall in October 2019 as it saw in 2007, but didn't suffer any flooding. 
New housing developments will be told to follow a design guide including water butts to catch water from drainpipes, permeable paving for rainwater and gardens filled with vegetation to soak up rain. 
Mr Tempest, who now has multiple lagoon areas designed to catch run-off water near his house in Cottingham, says: ""It has taken a long time, but they're not just blots on the landscape any more.
""They're green lagoons which look good and do feel very safe.""
Mr Pitcher says the unified approach agreed four years ago - which brought in authorities from around East Yorkshire - has helped to drive the changes.
""We're managing water throughout the system collectively - it doesn't matter where it came from originally, the fact is it's water in someone's garden, potentially in someone's house, or it's on the road and it's holding up traffic,"" he says.
""We collectively need to stop that from happening, and that mindset change might sound obvious, but it's making a huge difference.""
The approach is similar to the ""sponge city"" concept that is being rolled out in several Chinese cities, where floods could become something residents embrace rather than fear. Education is another key plank of Hull's strategy, and a ""flood curriculum"" is being taught in the city's schools. 
Pupils at Withernsea High School, 15 miles (24km) east of Hull, have created a film highlighting the impact of coastal erosion - another climate change-linked threat facing the area. 
Pupil Ellis Thomson, 13, says: ""Climate change is important to me as it is happening around me locally and I see it every day. 
""It makes me feel quite worried and sad because in a few years, some of the places that I have grown up knowing might be in the sea.""
Chloe Armitage, also 13, adds: ""If we don't get things right now, then what future will there be?""
Despite all its changes, Hull's unenviable position near the top of the at-risk list stubbornly remains. Thoughts have turned to whether even more radical solutions may be needed. The Environment Agency has warned water levels on the Humber could rise by over 3ft (1m) in the next 100 years, and ideas are being discussed on how best to protect and adapt for the long term.  
The Humber 2100+ project is considering not only conventional defences, but more ambitious solutions such as a multi-billion pound Humber tidal barrier four times the size of London's Thames Barrier.
Other ideas put forward include a lagoon on the estuary to create a giant shield against tidal flooding.
The Shorelines Project, a group which commissions climate change-related murals across the city, says their often provocative pieces may help people consider not only their own lives but those of generations to come. 
""It's about sparking a discussion but it's also about being hopeful, it's about making decisions that believe in future generations having a future,"" says project director Naomi Luhde-Thompson.  
Prof Parsons says: ""It's not about a 'Venice of the north' type narrative, there are ways we can manage the risk that are sustainable and lead to a long, prosperous future for Hull but we need to embrace the solutions and bring the communities with us.""

190,COP26,Douglas Fraser,COP26: Scotland's home-grown house of the future,2021-11-12,"With its glass gable, Scandi-colours and copper guttering, the COP house is an unlikely cottage design for its current location. 
It's in the shadow of Glasgow's Kingston motorway bridge, resting on railway sleepers atop the site of a former petrol station.
Its neighbour is a marquee where you can see an innovative vertical farming system that came out of Scottish agriculture research.
Visitors for the climate change conference can see the design of a home that features not only conventional Scottish timber - floor, walls, roof and insulation - but a twist of hemlock wood in its interior. 
The design captures sunlight and body warmth, while drawing the warmth of stale air as it's expelled to warm the fresh incoming air. Hardly any additional heating will be required. 
Having been designed in sections which can be unscrewed, the two-bedroom cottage, with its spectacular living room/kitchen will be dismantled on Clydeside and taken to a permanent home near Aviemore, as one of 12 such houses in a social housing development.
Peter Smith, the designer with Roderick James Architects, says that the timber represents around 50 tonnes of carbon dioxide captured in its growth. That's at a ratio of roughly one tonne of timber to one tonne of CO2.
A calculation of the emissions resulting from the manufacture of the house comes to 25 tonnes. 
Hence, building such a home can be seen to capture twice as much of the greenhouse gas as is emitted. The house itself is a sort of carbon sink. And once its life is over on Speyside, all the materials can be recycled.
Much of the technical challenge and cost of Scotland's home heating challenge has to do with retrofitting existing homes. 
That is being tested with a trial of how to put a draft-proof insulating blanket round an eight-apartment, pre-1918 tenement block in Glasgow's Southside. 
The project indicates that the cost will be high and residents will have to move out while the fabric of their homes is ripped apart. Research extends to other historic buildings around the country.
Meanwhile, for new buildings, such as the COP House, the required standards are being ramped up. The draft national planning framework, published this week, says their location should not encourage more use of private cars. Gas connections will be barred. 
Innovation in the materials for such homes is on show during COP26 at the Glasgow Landing site, where the COP House can be found, and at the factory in Hamilton which is home to the Construction Scotland Innovation Centre. 
Its COP displays are also notable for using Scottish-grown timber. This has long been seen as relatively weak, because it grows fast, and wet, because it rains so much - so it has been good only for fence posts, pallets and biomass.
Wood for construction of new homes is usually imported from Scandinavia, bringing with it the cost and carbon resulting from trucking and shipping.
In Hamilton, they're showing what can be done with cross-laminated timber (CLT). This has been imported from Spain before, but is being made for the first time in Scotland with Scottish wood.
A large form of plywood, it's made of planks laid across each other, each layer at right angles to the one below. Three or five planks thick, they're then glued and sealed under a large and very strong rubber vacuum press. 
The results are on show in the first two-storey house made of Scots CLT, with enough strength in the wood to build them on top of each other in a new form of tenement block.
As part of a project for the Department of Education in Whitehall, the factory also has a prototype classroom constructed from the same materials.
The material is being adapted for the retrofit of buildings to make new workspaces for those who are no longer commuting to city centres, but using commercial space nearer their homes.
Matt Stevenson, the designer and founder of ECOSystems Technologies based in Invergordon, is a former steel sculptor who explains that there are 'biophilic' properties to working in a wood building: citing research that shows pupils and teachers can expect to have better concentration and attainment as well as lowered blood pressure. 
In charge of the Construction Scotland Innovation Centre, Stephen Good is upbeat about the challenge ahead: 
""This is the biggest engineering project we've had to tackle in getting to net zero - how we decarbonise our existing built environment, decarbonise heat, and energy efficiency across every building type. 
""It's massive - hugely massive - but hugely exciting, because the industry's coming together to collaborate like never before.""

191,COP26,Tomos Lewis & Steffan Messenger,"COP26: Consequences of not acting profound for Wales, says Lee Waters",2021-11-12,"The consequence of not acting on global warming after the COP26 conference will be ""profound"" for Wales, the deputy climate change minister has said. 
Lee Waters warned the stakes were ""very, very high"" and the science was ""terrifying"" as the global climate conference in Glasgow draws to a close.
Delegates from 200 countries have been discussing how to limit global warming.
Before the conference, First Minister Mark Drakeford said it must give a ""sense of hope for the future"". 
Experts in Wales have warned extreme weather events will threaten lives and make people poorer if global warming is not curbed. 
Mr Waters said climate change targets would continue to be key in Wales, regardless of the outcome of the conference. 
He said: ""Achieving net zero [emissions] exists separately, in my view.
""We have to do it regardless of whether COP agrees, and each individual member has his own responsibility.
""Wales has a contribution to make - every person in Wales has a contribution to make, as does the government. We should focus on that because the science is clear and it is terrifying, and we must act.""
Read more about the COP26 summit here.
He added: ""Change will be very difficult for some communities, it is the role of government to help those communities make the change. 
""If tackling climate change is seen as a great sacrifice, people are going to be reluctant to do it. 
""Our role is to show that it's possible to change, and change can improve things. We can have a better quality of life if we do this in a managed way.""
He said he had taken ""courage"" from the summit to ""continue to keep pushing forward and not be distracted by people who are not willing to make the change"". 
Although there are numerous projections, the most optimistic view is promises made in Glasgow put the world on course for a 1.8C increase in average global temperature. 
But this depends on action being taken this decade. 
Previous pledges predicted a rise of 2.7C of warming by the end of the century.
Mr Waters is one of many politicians, campaigners and charities from Wales who have made their way to Scotland for the conference. 
Among them are the Youth Climate Ambassadors for Wales, who have been speaking at events, meeting delegates and campaigning.  
Shenona Mitra, from Bangor, Gwynedd, said it had been an ""intense"" experience. 
""It'll be really interesting to see after this whether the momentum stays and whether promises turn into actions,"" she said.
Another of the youth ambassadors, Ellie Sanders, from Swansea, described being at the conference as ""an amazing opportunity.""
Meanwhile, Leo Carey-Read, from Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said he found COP to be an ""eye-opening experience"". 
He added he felt ""hopeful in some senses, but I think I'd be naÃ¯ve to think that the 26th COP would be the final one"", but he ""definitely"" felt progress had been made. 
Leading climate change academic, Prof Mary Gagen of Swansea University, said side events involving young climate activists at Glasgow had been ""energising"". 
She said: ""It's really uplifting. I'm a climate scientist, one of the generations and generations of us who've been working on climate science since Guy Callendar first discovered human-induced climate change in 1938. 
""We need the energy of these sessions to keep working. It's lovely to hear youth activists, indigenous leader from Brazil and Peru, talking about the impact of climate change on their lives and their hopes for the future.""

192,Climate change,BBC News,COP26: Activists deflate tyres on 'luxury' cars in Glasgow,2021-11-12,"Climate activists say they have deflated tyres on ""luxury"" vehicles parked in Glasgow, to raise awareness of carbon emissions during COP26.
A number of SUVs in the city's upmarket West End were left with flyers that branded them a ""climate violation"".
Police Scotland said it was aware of the incidents and it had upped patrols in the area.
Thousands of campaigners travelled to Glasgow in recent weeks for the UN climate summit, which ends on Friday.
Pharmacist Jamie MacConnacher discovered the two front tyres of his Land Rover had been flattened on Thursday morning.
He told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme  that several other cars in the area had been targeted.
He said: ""I don't think targeting individuals that have these vehicles is the right way to do it. They don't know what the reason for somebody having that car is.""
He added: ""I understand that there is a need for change, I'm totally for that. I would have an electric car but it's the logistics in the west end of Glasgow. 
""There's nowhere to charge outside your flat so it just doesn't work for me.""
A flyer left on Mr MacConnacher's vehicle said it was ""driving the climate breakdown"", particularly in poor countries.
The activist group Tyred of SUVs later claimed responsibility, saying they had deflated tyres of around 60 vehicles in the ""rich neighbourhood"".
The group said: ""If 4x4 drivers were a nation, they'd be the seventh biggest polluters on the planet. If the 1% won't take responsibility for the climate destruction they wreak, we'll make them."" 
Tyred of SUVs member, Fin, told BBC Radio Scotland: ""We feel we need to do this because we need to point to the people who are responsible - rich people in the global north.
""This is a minor inconvenience that is not going to disrupt them in a huge way. What is really going to disrupt people's lives and kill them is the climate crisis caused by rich people -  basically SUV owners.""
She added: ""The importance of this message made it necessary and warranted this disruption.""
Mr MacConnacher, who drives 25 miles to Aberfoyle, Stirlingshire, each day for work, said he needs a large car as he often faces ""challenging conditions"" on the road in winter.
On Thursday he was 45 minutes late for work as he had access to a tyre pump - but said there could have been consequences for his patients.
""It's not something that's going to cost me any money, but it's still tampering with someone else's vehicle,"" he added.
""I have to get to my patients - fortunately I wasn't that late for work but if I hadn't had a pump I could have been hours late.
""The knock-on effect of that could be quite significant. We could have a lot of antibiotics needing given out, we've got palliative care patients that need access to care at end of life.""
Police Scotland said: ""We are aware of these incidents and there will increased patrols in the  area to provide reassurance to local residents.""

193,COP26,Paul Rincon,Seven ways to curb climate change,2021-11-12,"The COP26 climate summit in Glasgow has been billed as a last chance to limit global warming to 1.5C. 
But beyond the deals and photo opportunities, what are the key things countries need to do in order to tackle climate change?
Burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and especially coal, releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, trapping heat and raising global temperatures. 
It's an issue which has to be tackled at government level if temperature rises are to be limited to 1.5C - the level considered the gateway to dangerous climate change. 
However, many major coal-dependent countries - such as Australia, the US, China and India - have declined to sign a deal at the summit aimed at phasing out the energy source in the coming decades. 
A recent UN report has suggested that reducing emissions of methane could make an important contribution to tackling the planetary emergency. 
A substantial amount of methane is released from ""flaring"" - the burning of natural gas during oil extraction - and could be stopped with technical fixes. Finding better ways of disposing of rubbish is also important, because landfill sites are another big methane source.
At COP26, nearly 100 countries agreed to cut methane emissions, in a deal spearheaded by the US and the EU. The Global Methane Pledge aims to limit methane emissions by 30% compared with 2020 levels.
Electricity and heat generation make a greater contribution to global emissions than any economic sector. 
Transforming the global energy system from one reliant on fossil fuels to one dominated by clean technology - known as decarbonisation - is critical for meeting current climate goals. 
Wind and solar power will need to dominate the energy mix by 2050 if countries are to deliver on their net zero targets.
There are challenges, however.
Less wind means less electricity generated, but better battery technology could help us store surplus energy from renewables, ready to be released when needed.
We'll also need to change the way we power the vehicles we use to get around on land, sea and in the air. 
Ditching petrol and diesel cars and switching to electric vehicles will be critical. 
Lorries and buses could be powered by hydrogen fuel, ideally produced using renewable energy. 
And scientists are working on new, cleaner fuels for aircraft, although campaigners are also urging people to reduce the number of flights they take. 
A UN report in 2018 said that, to have a realistic chance of keeping the global temperature rise under 1.5C, we'll have to remove CO2 from the air. 
Forests are excellent at soaking it up from the atmosphere - one reason why campaigners and scientists emphasise the need to protect the natural world by reducing deforestation. 
Programmes of mass tree-planting are seen as a way of offsetting CO2 emissions. 
Trees are likely to be important as countries wrestle with their net zero targets, because once emissions have been reduced as much as possible, remaining emissions could be ""cancelled out"" by carbon sinks such as forests. 
Emerging technologies that artificially remove CO2 from the atmosphere, or stop it being released in the first place, could play a role. 
A number of direct-air capture facilities are being developed, including plants built by Carbon Engineering in Texas and Climeworks in Switzerland. They work by using huge fans to push air through a chemical filter that absorbs CO2. 
Another method is carbon capture and storage, which captures emissions at ""point sources"" where they are produced, such as at coal-fired power plants. The CO2 is then buried deep underground. 
However, the technology is expensive - and controversial, because it is seen by critics as helping perpetuate a reliance on fossil fuels. 
At the Copenhagen COP summit in 2009, rich countries pledged to provide $100bn (Â£74.6bn) in financing by 2020, designed to help developing countries fight and adapt to climate change. 
That target date has not been met, although the UK government, as holders of the COP presidency, recently outlined a plan for putting the funding in place by 2023. 
Many coal-dependent countries are facing severe energy shortages that jeopardise their recovery from Covid and disproportionately affect the poor. These factors stop them moving away from polluting industries.  
Some experts believe poorer nations will need continuing financial support to help them move towards greener energy. For instance, the US, EU and UK recently provided $8.5bn to help South Africa phase out coal use.

194,General,BBC News,Title of article,2021-11-11,"The question of how people in Scotland could heat their homes in the future is a pertinent one, with the COP26 climate conference taking place in Glasgow.
Up to a fifth of all greenhouse gases in Scotland come from homes and buildings, so changing the way we all heat our properties is one of the key debates as the country strives to achieve its target of ânet zeroâ emissions by 2045.
The BBCâs Connor Gillies explores the issue.

195,COP26,glas Fraser,Home discomforts at COP26,2021-11-11,"Replacing your belchy old diesel car with a shiny new one run on batteries is a relatively simple element of going green. 
Selling it and using public transport instead is simpler and greener, and avoids having to find a charging point.
But in the great energy transition, getting your home ready for climate neutrality, or net zero, is far from simple.
In Scotland alone, more than two million homes use gas central heating. Nearly 200,000 more - usually rural - have boilers that burn oil.
They all have to be replaced, and before long. Homes account for around 16% of Scotland's emissions, much of that through poor insulation.
Heating other buildings, public and private, accounts for 6% more.
But what is to replace those boilers? The question of which technology should replace them is still open. There are different answers for different properties. 
The pace of technological development for each one is unclear. There isn't yet sufficient manufacturing capacity for all the air or ground source pumps that will be needed.
Nor is the pricing clear. A shift from gas to electricity has left many paying much higher bills. But the price signals may be switched, to discourage further gas and push people to electricity. We don't know yet.
That helps explain the reluctance to commit to new forms of renewable heating.  The Scottish government set a target of 11% of home heating from renewable sources by 2020.  
The outcome was recently published, showing it reached only 6.4%. It was going backwards - the figure was 6.6% in 2019. The new minister responsible for the policy, Green MSP Patrick Harvie, described it as ""disappointing"".
Earlier this autumn, in his first ministerial statement, he set out a home heating strategy that indicated a total bill of Â£33bn to make the transition to new heating sources and better insulated homes.
It set out the aim of more than one million homes converting to zero emission heating by the end of this decade, and 50,000 non-domestic buildings.
Emissions are meant to fall by 68% over that time, when compared with last year.
To get there, new forms of heating will have to be installed in 124,000 homes by 2026, then rising to more than 200,000 per year.
Progress so far is a long way short of that. Last year, there were only 3020 heat pump systems installed, bringing the total so far to an unimpressive 21,000. 
There is a Warmer Homes Scotland fund for those at risk of fuel poverty. Its impact is even more underwhelming. 
In four years, it has led to only 69 homes being fitted with photo-voltaic cells. In the same four years, fewer than 500 homes have been fitted with air source heat pumps.
What does the Â£33bn represent? It's roughly half of all the spending by governments in Scotland in one year, including pensions, benefits and public services.
Unlike those, it's capital investment, so it gives lasting returns. However, it's six times the size of this year's Scottish government capital budget.
And it comes to around Â£6000 per head.
The better news is that it is spending that should generate jobs in manufacturing and installation.  The Scottish government estimates that could be 16,400 new roles.
Much of the bill will fall to private homeowners, who account for most homes in Scotland. 
There is no indication yet of how much support there will be by the Scottish or UK governments, or if it will be driven by pricing signals that governments force utilities to adopt.

When we talk of 'subsidy' for renewable power, it's bill payers who meet that, and not government.
For those who don't own their homes, the Scottish Federation of Social Housing says the money on offer from the Scottish government is a long way from being adequate.
Chief executive Sally Thomas told me that Â£1.8bn has been allocated to improved home heating over a six year period, and that is meant to cover every type of housing.  But for the social rented sector alone, which has relatively good quality stock after years of improvements, the bill looks like Â£6bn.
What concerns her most, she adds, is the problem of fuel poverty - those who have to pay more than 10% of disposable income to meet their energy bills. That accounts for quarter of households, or 1.2m people, she says, and a third of social renters.
They have to be taken on the ""net zero journey"", and can't be left with new heating technology that doesn't work for them, or that makes their homes more expensive to heat.
Nor can boilers be the only answer, if heat is then escaping from drafty building fabric, windows and roofs. Improved insulation is a much bigger technical and financial challenge in existing housing stock, and for windswept Scotland in particular.
The Scottish government knows it's not enough, adds Sally Thomas.  Among the options are private investment and debt funding. There's a lot of investment money looking for a green home, even if financial returns are unexciting.
The Scottish government acknowledges its funding is only the start. There is innovation and regulation as well, a spokesman points out. There's a fund for social landlords, which was opened last year.
And there's a target - another target, this time for 2033 - for all homes to reach a minimum C-grade in Energy Performance Certificates, where that's feasible.
If they don't make it, Patrick Harvie's election manifesto earlier this year proposed that owners of such homes could be barred from selling them. 
It was argued that climate emergency requires drastic action, and if you can force scrappage of the dirtiest, most inefficient vehicles, then why not buildings?
That's not a policy of the Scottish government, yet.

197,Climate change,BBC News,Scotland to ban most single-use plastic from June 2022,2021-11-11,"A ban on most single-use plastics will come into effect in Scotland from June next year.
The legislation will ban the use of plastic cutlery, drink stirrers and food containers made from expanded polystyrene.
An exemption will be in place for people who need plastic straws for medical reasons or to ensure they can continue to live independently.
Scotland is the first UK nation to pursue the ban.
Circular Economy Minister Lorna Slater said:  ""Every year, hundreds of millions of pieces of single-use plastic are wasted. They litter our coasts, pollute our oceans and contribute to the climate emergency.
""That has to end and this ban will be another step forward in the fight against plastic waste and throwaway culture.
""This is another example of the sort of bold action that is needed if we are to deliver on the commitments that are being made at Cop26.""
But Ms Slater said the Internal Market Act passed at Westminster last year could create issues with the ban.
She said it effectively exempted any items that were produced in or imported via another part of the UK.
""I will be writing to the UK government to ask that they take the necessary steps to ensure the integrity of this ban,"" she added.
Scottish Lib Dem climate emergency spokesman, Liam McArthur, said the legislation was a step in the right direction, but ""nowhere near the scale of action needed"".
He added: ""The Scottish government are tinkering round the edges, and have failed to motivate change. They parked their Circular Economy Bill, and even with a Green minister in charge important policies won't be seen for years to come.
""The waste pile just keeps on growing. The pandemic has already backtracked progress, and more delays will be hugely damaging."" 
WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said the global climate impact of plastic was equivalent to the output of almost 200 coal-fired power stations annually.
He added: ""If we're to stop climate change and eliminate plastic pollution from our oceans, we need to rapidly phase out unnecessary single-use plastics.""

""Nandi and Roman used music as a way to share their compelling message about why we need to take action on climate change.""
The 11-year-old replied on Twitter: ""This is INCREDIBLE!!!""
She wrote: ""I am SO proud you shared the song Roman and [I] wrote to help raise awareness of climate change on Facebook!!! AMAZING!!!""
Nandi, who began drumming aged five, previously challenged Dave Grohl to a ""drum off"" over social media, with the pair exchanging videos.
She also plays the bass, guitar and piano and has played the drums with Queen's Roger Taylor, as well as appearing on the Ellen Show.

200,COP26,BBC News,My Day at COP26: 'Anything we achieve in Glasgow is not going to be enough',2021-11-11,"Bangladeshi climate scientist, Saleemul Huq, is at COP26 to advise the world's least developed countries. In the latest in a series of first-person accounts, he describes the mood as the UN climate conference nears its conclusion.
This is my 26th COP, I've actually been to every single one. I'm not here as a negotiator but as an adviser to the group of Least Developed Countries - the 46 countries who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. 
My own country is badly affected - there are nearly 170 million people in Bangladesh living on less than 150,000 sq km on the delta of two of the world's biggest rivers, the Ganges and Brahmaputra. Because of this, vast numbers of people are extremely vulnerable.
I originally started advising the group of Least Developed Countries on the issue of adaptation to climate change, but now that we're suffering the impacts of climate change we're no longer simply able to adapt to it. So, more recently, I've been advising them on a new and emerging topic - loss and damage from climate change. It's a highly politically contentious issue - rich countries don't like talking about it because they feel it will open them up to liability and compensation claims. 
Yesterday, we saw the first draft of the agreement. There's a great deal of disappointment in the lack of ambition in that draft, but in calling for more support for developing countries and recognising that more finance is needed, I think they've done something quite positive on loss and damage. That's the one issue that I was wishing and fighting for and we can now build on this for COP27 next year, which will be an African COP.
My Day at COP26:
There have been two weeks of meetings here. They go through ups and downs. Some are more important than others, some very technical, some highly political. But the core business is the negotiations.
Now that we have asked for revisions to the draft agreement, we are waiting to see what the presidency does next. These last-minute deals are all dependent on how strongly countries express their views on what they want included and what they want excluded. 
We have a history of going into overtime at COP which muddies the waters and makes people angry and not willing to compromise. We have just over 24 hours to go and I get a sense that things are moving in the right direction. The atmospherics are positive. Yesterday, we had a big announcement from China and the US that they would work together - so that's a very good thing. 
The only caveat is that anything we achieve here in Glasgow is not going to be enough. But it will be something, and so we'll celebrate something, while knowing that it isn't enough.
As told to Sarah McDermott
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

201,COP26,BBC News,COP26: John Prescott goes from two Jags to zero Jags,2021-11-11,"Labour's Lord Prescott - who was dubbed ""two Jags"" after it emerged he had two official Jaguar cars - has revealed he no longer has a motor vehicle.
The former deputy prime minister was once criticised for using one of his cars to drive 200 yards.
But his son David told the BBC he had now given up cars for good. 
And writing in The Times, Lord Prescott said he was making his ""own small contribution to cutting carbon emissions"". 
""I am now Zero Jags - selling a car or eating fish and chips with a lower carbon footprint alone won't save the planet, but as the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu once said, ""Great acts are made up of small deeds,"" he wrote. 
In 1997, Lord Prescott was a lead EU negotiator at the Kyoto climate conference which produced the first global agreement on cutting carbon emissions in 1997.
The Kyoto Protocol committed industrialised countries to cut their emissions by 5% below 1990 levels - but climate scientists at the time warned the targets were not strong enough.
This week, Lord Prescott has been visiting the climate talks in Glasgow to promote his work with the University of Hull in cutting carbon emissions around the Humber estuary.
The world's biggest offshore wind farm is situated off the estuary and the city of Hull, which Lord Prescott represented in the House of Commons for nearly 40 years. 
In his first broadcast interview since suffering a stroke three years ago, he told BBC Breakfast he used to sail down the estuary when he was a merchant seaman, but the focus was now on ""new industry"".
Speaking to the BBC, his son David said his father views the climate conference as ""unfinished business"". 
He said climate change had ""driven him for years... it is something that drives him still.""
His family say his commitment to the cause is such that he is missing his 60th wedding anniversary to be at the conference.
Some 200 countries are attending the UN COP26 summit, which is the biggest climate change conference since landmark talks in Paris in 2015. 
The world's leaders are being asked to produce plans for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.
Professor Dan Parsons who is accompanying the Labour peer to Glasgow, argues that it is unfair Lord Prescott is often dubbed ""two Jags"".
He argues that the politicians has been ""instrumental"" in securing international agreements on climate change. 
Lord Prescott was given the nickname after it emerged he had two official Jaguar cars.
He also received criticism in 1999 for making a 200 yard journey by car, at a Labour Party conference in Bournemouth, to make a speech asking motorists to cut down on their journeys. 
At the time, Lord Prescott said he had taken the car because his wife didn't like to have her hair blown about.

202,Climate change,BBC News,Climate change: Wales pledges to stop licensed oil and gas production,2021-11-11,"Wales has joined a new global alliance of countries pledging to stop licensing oil and gas production in an effort to fight climate change.
Ten national and regional governments have signed up in a move led by Costa Rica and Denmark.
Deputy climate change minister Lee Waters said it showed Wales ""at the forefront"" of global warming action.
The founding members also include France, Greenland, Ireland, Quebec, California and New Zealand.
Mr Waters said: ""We have committed to using all of our powers to phase out fossil fuels, through our planning frameworks, licensing powers and our policy frameworks which set out a strong presumption against new fossil fuelled power plants.""
Within the UK, the Welsh government is going it alone with neither Westminster or Scottish governments involved in today's announcement.
Under the Beyond Oil and Gas Declaration, the governments say they will ensure a ""managed phase out of oil and gas.""
It will be followed by ""concrete action"" - including a commitment to end new concessions, licensing or leasing rounds. 
There is also a promise to set a date for ending oil and gas production that aligns with the Paris Agreement goals of keeping the rise in global temperatures well below 2C. 
Powers over licensing for oil and gas extraction on land as well as in intertidal areas, estuaries and coastal inlets were devolved to the Welsh government in 2018.
Since then no new licenses have been granted and a number of extant licenses have been surrendered or terminated, said the deputy climate change minister, Lee Waters. 
Decisions over what happens further out at sea remains with the UK Government and Oil and Gas Authority - though reserves off the Welsh coast have been described as ""meagre.""
While Wales has a long history of coal mining, there has been minimal oil and gas extraction to date.
The last petroleum exploration development license in Wales was awarded by the UK Government in 2008. 
But in recent decades approaches have been made by firms keen to search for shale gas through a process known as fracking, as well as exploring the potential for extracting coalbed methane. 
Pembrokeshire is an important gateway for imported oil into the UK and is home to one of Europe's biggest gas fired power stations. 
Its operator RWE is hoping to be part of plans to build large floating windfarms off the Welsh coast as part of the transition to a low carbon economy in future.
Mr Waters said: ""Our vision is for a decarbonised energy system which provides wider economic and social benefits for Wales than the system we see today and we believe that replacing fossil fuels with low carbon sources will help Wales create the industries and jobs of the future.""

203,COP26,BBC News,COP26: How can an average family afford an electric car? And more questions,2021-11-11,"The COP26 climate summit is under way in Glasgow - one of the biggest ever world meetings on how to tackle global warming. 
BBC News Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris answers some of your questions.
You can send a question using the form at the bottom of this page.
How is the average family going to find the extra Â£20,000 needed to buy an electric vehicle?  Nicola Hippisley, London
You don't necessarily need an extra Â£20,000 to buy an electric vehicle. 
Overall, electric cars have been more expensive than petrol or diesel ones for some time, but the difference has been narrowing. 
The average cost of an electric car in the UK is about Â£44,000, but you can buy a basic one for less than Â£20,000. That's partly because the price of the batteries which electric cars use has fallen sharply in recent years. 
At the moment, the price of raw materials is threatening to push battery prices up again, but the industry expects that as electric car sales increase, economies of scale will kick in. 
Experts predict that new electric and petrol/diesel cars will cost the same within the next five years. It is also possible to lease an electric vehicle, and there's a growing second-hand market as well, where vehicles are much cheaper. 
The UK government currently offers a grant of up to Â£2,500 as a discount on the price of certain brand new low-emission vehicles including some electric models. 
You can also claim a grant of up to Â£350 to help meet the cost of installing a chargepoint at your house if you have dedicated off-street parking. This is available whether you lease your car or own it outright. 
Separately, the Scottish government offers interest-free loans to help people buy brand new or used electric vehicles. 
How will the decisions made at COP26 change our day-to-day lives? I want to know what I can do to help move these policies forward. Matthew Hadley, Harpenden
The decisions made at COP26 are part of the wider ambition to decarbonise our economies - and that will certainly have an impact on daily life. 
The cars we drive and the way we heat our homes are going to change. Buying an electric vehicle, or getting a heat pump installed at home, is going to become more and more common. The hope - and for many the expectation - is that as these technologies become more established, the costs will come down. 
There are also personal choices to be made about what we eat (the Climate Change Committee which advises the government recommends a 20% reduction per person by 2050 in the amount of beef, lamb and dairy we consume), and how often we fly. 
Then there are practical issues like recycling and cutting down on waste as much as possible. 
Why are we still referring to 2050 as some sort of end goal, since very little has changed in the last two decades? Wouldn't 2040 or perhaps even 2030 put a little more urgency into every little step humanity takes? Jake Kettmann, Bega, NSW, Australia
The year 2050 is the target date set by many countries for reaching net zero emissions of greenhouse gases. But you're not alone in thinking that 2050 is much too far in the future to force some politicians or companies to take action now. 
That's why there are also plenty of interim targets, and the 2020s have been identified as a critical decade for climate action - it can't all be delayed until the 10 years leading up to 2050.
Many of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases have now set targets for 2030, and the UN says overall emissions need to fall by 45% [by that date]compared to 2010 levels, if the aim of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels is to remain realistic. 
At the moment, though, the world is nowhere near achieving that, even with the new pledges made at COP26.
If scientists have already considered a 1.5C reduction goal will not be achieved, why don't we set up a new goal, which we may able to achieve? Ana, Vietnam
Quite a few scientists think it may already be too late to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, but they'd rather have an ambitious target to aim for. 
The Paris Agreement in 2015 set the goal of limiting global warming to well below 2C, and preferably to 1.5C. So ""well below 2C"" is already written into law as a secondary target. 
There's also a growing awareness of the need to take action which will make a difference in the next five to 10 years. That's why many of the agreements made at COP26 - to reverse deforestation, for example, or to cut global methane emissions by 30% - set 2030 as their target date. 
The challenge now of course is to turn those promises into practice, and to deliver urgent change.
How can we be sure the claims made about greenhouse gas emissions can be verified? What independent observer is measuring different countries' attempts to reduce their fossil fuel usage? Lee Gary, Spain
Checking claims made about greenhouse gas emissions is one of the biggest issues for negotiators at COP26. 
At the moment, countries only have to review and update their pledges for cutting emissions every five years. Many people argue that's not often enough, and some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change want to turn it into an annual process to keep the pressure on. 
The role of independent observer is supposed to be filled by UN scientists. But a recent investigation by The Washington Post found multiple examples of flawed or inaccurate data submitted to the UN by individual countries. It is another example of climate promises falling short of what is required, as a process which relies so heavily on data needs to ensure that the data is accurate.
Last month, a UN-backed body launched a scheme to verify net zero claims made by big companies, to ensure that corporate pledges can be easily compared and properly scrutinised.
Is there a way to force countries in the UN, especially China and India, to cut back to net zero by 2050? Can sanctions or similar trade restrictions be used against them? Diana Butungi, Kampala
Only a few countries have made their net zero pledges legally binding. Many of the national pledges are non-binding targets, but there is a hope that as momentum towards net zero begins to accelerate it will provide an incentive for others to follow. 
It would be possible in theory to impose trade or other sanctions on countries that are moving more slowly, but that could be counter-productive. The focus of meetings like COP26 is to try to encourage international cooperation. 
It's also unfair to put all the blame on countries like India and China for the majority of carbon emissions, even though China is the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world today and India is the third largest. China and India have huge populations, and much lower emissions per person than more developed countries.
In any case, it's important to consider the historical role played by European countries and the United States which are responsible for far more cumulative emissions than China or India. 
The damaging effects of emitting CO2 into the atmosphere linger for hundreds of years, and the rich world has acknowledged that it has the primary responsibility for tackling climate change.
Are there plans for governments and countries to invest in carbon-capture technologies on a very large scale? If not, why? Bernath Bence, Netherlands
The trouble with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is that the technology that does exist, won't be rolled out fast enough to make any significant difference this decade, when greenhouse gas emissions need to fall significantly.  
In 2020, for example, the UK allocated Â£1bn to a CCS infrastructure fund, with the ambition of capturing the equivalent of 10m metric tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030. 
That target has already been increased to capturing 20-30m metric tonnes by 2030. But, to put that in perspective, the UK is estimated to have produced the net equivalent of more than 450m metric tonnes of CO2 in 2019.
Government investment varies hugely around the world. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Australia are relying very heavily on CCS to allow them to continue producing fossil fuels for the foreseeable future, but that means scaling up the technology in a way which has not yet been proven to work effectively.  
How do agricultural products like rice and sugar contribute to the increase of CO2? What can we do to help reduce emissions? Ng Wee Meng, Singapore
Most forms of agriculture produce CO2 emissions in one way or another.  
Beef is widely agreed to be the most carbon-intensive food to produce globally, but there are emissions from sugar and rice - these are connected with factors such as deforestation, animal feed, energy used in processing and transport, and packaging. 
One study estimates that rice, for example, produces the equivalent of 4kg of CO2 emissions for every 1kg of rice produced. Given that 755 million tonnes of rice are produced every year around the world, that is a lot of CO2. On the other hand, rice is an essential staple food feeding billions around the world.  
The best way to help reduce emissions is to try to ensure you eat food which is produced as sustainably as possible - although many people may not have the luxury of that choice.
Would enforcing quotas for meat consumption and flight travels be efficient and feasible? Anonymous, Geneva
Meat eating (especially beef) and travelling by air both have a sizeable environmental impact. 
Eating one or two hamburgers a week for a year creates the same amount of greenhouse gases as heating a UK home for 95 days.
And a return economy flight from London to New York emits about 0.67 tonnes of CO2. That's 11% of the average annual emissions for someone in the UK.
In theory, enforced quotas for meat consumption or flying would make a difference, but there's little political appetite or support for that to happen. Instead, the focus is on encouraging behavioural change. 
The UK Climate Change Committee - which advises the government - has recommended that people should consume 20% less meat and dairy by 2030, and 35% less by 2050. People are also being urged to think about flying less. 
Using taxation to make certain things more expensive would probably be a more realistic solution than trying to enforce quotas. 
Why can't we have an international fund to help poorer countries attain zero carbon emissions? Robert Patterson, Darlington
That is partly what the current debate on climate finance is all about. 
In 2009, rich countries said they would provide $100bn (Â£73bn) every year to the developing world by 2020. But they have been unable to live up to their promise, and they are now suggesting they will only meet that target in 2023. 
Poorer countries need this money to help tackle the effects of climate change that they are already facing. But they also need it to make sure their economies become greener as they develop, on a path to net zero carbon emissions.   
If it is people causing climate change, what is being done to stop over-population ? Gaye Schmidt, Perth, Australia
Overpopulation isn't the root cause of climate change. Rather, it's the excessive emission of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet up. And the richest one per cent of the world's population is responsible for more carbon emissions than the poorest fifty per cent. 
It is true to say the population of the planet can't keep increasing indefinitely, because there is a finite number of resources available. But excessive consumption has played a larger role in climate change than a growing global population.
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.
Is the global capitalist model not at odds with climate change and the need for a greener way of life? Andrew, Exeter
Matt McGrath writes:
According to some experts, such as the economist Lord Stern, climate change can be seen as the great failure of the market. 
This is because businesses have not generally had to pay for the damage they have caused to the environment.
Global efforts to tackle climate change over the past two decades have focused more on harnessing capitalism to limit warming - for instance, putting a price on carbon and making the polluter pay, to ensure that emissions are ultimately restricted.
Meanwhile, it's also the case that if there's consumer demand for greener products and services, capitalism will try to meet that demand.
But there's evidently still a lot of work to be done to make these approaches work.
Does COP26 really need 25,000 people there? They will generate a lot of CO2, so why can't many elements be online? David, Birmingham
Matt McGrath writes:
The pandemic might be seen as the perfect moment for the UN to use technology for negotiations, and it was attempted during a preparatory meeting for COP in June, which ran for three weeks.
Unfortunately, it didn't go well - time-zone and technology challenges made it almost impossible for countries with limited resources, progress was limited and decisions were put off.
As a result, many developing nations have insisted on having an in-person COP. They feel that it is far easier for their voices to be ignored on a dodgy Zoom connection.
They also bring a lived experience of climate change that it is critical for rich countries to hear first-hand.
There's some evidence that this works. In 2015, the presence of island states and vulnerable nations was key to securing the commitment to limit temperature changes to 1.5C in the Paris Agreement.

204,COP26,BBC News,COP26: Cautious welcome for unexpected US-China climate agreement,2021-11-11,"Activists and politicians have cautiously welcomed an unexpected US-China declaration that vowed to boost climate co-operation. 
The EU and UN described the move as encouraging and an important step, but Greenpeace said both countries needed to take concrete action.
The US and China are the world's two biggest CO2 emitters.
They said they would work together to achieve the 1.5C temperature goal set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement.
Scientists say that limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C will help humanity avoid the worst climate impacts. This is compared with pre-industrial temperatures.
While the latest pledge is short on detail, analysts say it is a tacit acknowledgement by China that the crisis warrants urgent attention and that it will play a bigger role in confronting the global challenge.
The announcement by the two global rivals was made on Wednesday at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, which officially ends on Friday.
US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are now expected to hold a virtual meeting as early as next week. 
According to China's climate envoy, the declaration was agreed following some 30 meetings with the US over the past 10 months. 
It pledges close co-operation on cutting emissions, while a joint working group will also ""meet regularly to address the climate crisis"" over the next decade.
The reaction to the surprise agreement has been largely positive, but experts and activists have warned that policies must now be enacted to support the promises.
Genevieve Maricle, director of US climate policy action at pressure group WWF, said the announcement offered ""new hope"" that the 1.5C limit might be achieved.
But she added that ""we must also be clear eyed about what is still required if the two countries are to deliver the emission reductions necessary in the next nine years"".
Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan warned that China and the US needed to show greater commitment to reaching climate goals.
Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who is president of the Asia Society which works on global climate change agreements, told the BBC that the agreement was ""not a gamechanger"" but was a big step forward.
""The current state of geopolitics between China and the United States is awful, so the fact that you can extract this... agreement between Washington and Beijing right now is [important],"" he said.
The US-China declaration calls for increased efforts to close the ""significant gap"" that remains to achieve that 1.5C target.
There were steps agreed on a range of issues including methane emissions, the transition to clean energy and de-carbonisation.
China's top climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua told reporters that on climate change ""there is more agreement between China and US than divergence"".
China refused to join an agreement earlier this week to limit methane - a harmful greenhouse gas, but has instead pledged to develop a ""national plan"" to address the issue. 
Mr Xie was followed by John Kerry, the US climate envoy, who said that while US and China had many differences, co-operation on climate was vital.
""Every step matters right now and we have a long journey ahead of us,"" he said.
China is the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, followed by the US. In September Mr Xi announced that China would aim for carbon neutrality by 2060, with a plan to hit peak emissions before 2030. 
The US is aiming for net-zero by 2050.

There's been a cautious welcome by activists and politicians to the unexpected announcement that the US and China would work together to tackle climate change. The EU and UN say the declaration is encouraging, and an important step, while Greenpeace believes the two nations need to show greater commitment to reaching climate goals. The US-China declaration was announced as COP26 in Glasgow nears its end sees the two countries - the two biggest carbon dioxide, CO2, emitters in the world - vow to boost climate co-operation over the next decade. The global rivals say they will work together to achieve the 1.5C temperature goal set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Keep up with the day's events here.
Despite promises to invest in green energy, many governments still financially back the fossil fuel industry - emissions from which are one of the primary causes of global warming. According to the UN Development Programme, the world spends more than $420bn (Â£313bn) a year subsidising non-renewable energy. But what are fossil fuel subsidies and which countries are spending the most? Find out here.
Mitzi Jonelle Tan from the Philippines, Gaston Tenembaum from Argentina, and Dominique Palmer from London are passionate about the environment. They are all attending COP26 and we've asked them some questions about climate change, their hopes for the conference and their advice for dealing with eco-anxiety. Watch what these climate activists have to say.

Every year the Artivist Network - a group of artists and activists - find a space to paint a mural during COP, to leave something permanent and thought-provoking behind after negotiations. It's so people don't  forget that this happened in their city, says Daniel Rupaszov, 25, from Hungary. The group visits COP every year to create art that highlights the climate crisis, he says, as he tells us about the murals he's painting.
Instead of fearing floods, one man has come up with an idea to embrace them by creating sponge cities to soak up rainfall. Inspired by a near death experience where he was swept intoÂ a river, Yu Kongjian decided to use the environment to soak up water, like a sponge.

With just days to go until COP26 finishes, here's a reminder of the UK's climate change strategy. The government wants to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a number of ways including a new push towards electric vehicles. The UK's made progress in cutting emissions compared with the levels in 1990, and experts are analysing whether this strategy is enough to meet the 2050 target. They've already pointed out eating less meat or reducing demand for flying - both big sources of emissions - are missing.

207,COP26,Steve Mather,COP26: Bristol group takes environmental diversity message to summit,2021-11-11,"A community project which aims to increase diversity in environmental decision-making has taken its message to the COP26 climate change summit. 
Olivia Sweeney and Roy Kareem, of Bristol-based Black and Green Ambassadors, spoke about making the environmental movement more inclusive.
They said it felt like recognition of the group's work to speak at the event.
""I think they recognised that we are doing something special and unusual,"" said Mr Kareem.
Black and Green Ambassadors was launched after Bristol won the European Green Capital award in 2015, and aims to ensure the talk around climate and the environment is accessible and representative of all communities.
After a few fallow years when funding was unavailable, the group was relaunched last year and is now looking to expand and become self-sustainable.
Ms Sweeney, 27, said their work was about addressing inequalities and ensuring diverse action for the environment.
""At COP we were talking about climate justice and getting marginalised people involved in decision making and system change around the world. Creating a new world and the need to be more equitable.
""We want to create a network so it's not just a few voices,"" she said.
As part of her work, Ms Sweeney has launched a clean air project, saying that air quality issues in Bristol impact BAME people disproportionately.
""There needs to be a commitment to accountability and not just targets without action plans,"" she added.
Mr Kareem spent time as a primary school teacher before becoming a director for Bright Green Future, an environmental training programme for teenagers.
The 43-year-old specialises in urban green spaces and the connection that nature has on wellbeing and health. 
He told the audience at COP26 that the Black and Green Ambassadors have helped shine a light on the links between local actions and global issues.
""We want to keep expanding to become a network of people and take the message to a wider audience. 
""We are now getting into certain rooms and stages that we weren't before,"" he said.
Mr Kareem said it was heartening to meet people from across the globe who were interested in replicating Black and Green's work in their own communities.
""We were on one of the larger stages and when you wandered out there were lots of other stages and into Glasgow there were lots of other venues, so to get that position, I think they recognised that we are doing something special and unusual.
""I genuinely think it is a good level of recognition for a small group from Bristol to be invited to speak at COP,"" he added.
Despite enjoying the opportunity to speak, they were both sceptical about if COP26 would be looked back on as a success.
""This years COP feels much more mainstream than it was, but I don't think it's a vehicle for change that includes justice,"" said Ms Sweeney.
Mr Kareem added that targets were ""nowhere near ambitious enough"".

209,Climate change,Susie Forrest,Baby steps to cutting NHS Scotland's carbon footprint,2021-11-11,"On the day the Scottish government published its strategy for a net-zero NHS by 2040, baby Airlie Autumn Lavery was taking her first breaths in the labour ward of St John's hospital in Livingston.
Her mum, Sinead, used gas and air for pain relief in the birthing pool. But she was unaware of the small contribution she was making to the fight against climate change.
The Entonox she was breathing in contains nitrous oxide - a greenhouse gas which lasts around 100 years in the atmosphere, and whose global warming potential is around 300 times greater than carbon dioxide.
But midwives in NHS Lothian are using a new machine, developed in Sweden, to destroy the nitrous oxide and convert it back into harmless gases.
As they welcomed their fourth child into the world, 30-year-old Sinead and her husband Robbie, 32, were none the wiser.
""We are pretty climate conscious as a family so to have that knowledge of it, after the fact, is really great,"" says Robbie, from Symington in Lanarkshire.
""I think it is a great initiative and the more stuff like this, the better it is going to be for the climate - and the kids.""
Gas and air is the most popular type of pain relief in childbirth, but senior charge midwife Jane Taylor says most people don't realise the harm it does. 
""Over 70% of our women use Entonox during their labour at some point, so that is a huge carbon footprint that has a huge impact on the climate. 
""When women are in labour we don't expect them to be worrying about climate change. So if we can do something to reduce that behind the scenes we are happy to do that""
This maternity unit is the only one in Scotland, and the second in the UK, to trial the technology. The hope is that it will be more widely used in future.
Anaesthetic gases released into the atmosphere account for around 5% of the carbon footprint of NHS acute hospitals. The biggest contributor is Entonox - but gases used to keep patients asleep during surgery are also highly damaging to the atmosphere.
NHS Lothian consultant anaesthetist Dr Andrew Goddard says they've worked hard to reduce the use of these harmful gases in the operating theatre, by using different kinds of gases or using a lower flow through the anaesthetic machine. But that has a limited impact.
""Almost everything we put into the patient has to be exhaled and dealt with at the end of the procedure,"" he says.
""You can think of an hour's worth of general anaesthetic compared to the number of miles driven in the car, by calculating the equivalent quantity of carbon dioxide emitted.""
""An hour's worth of an anaesthetic is in the region of driving 100, 200 or 300 miles in a car.""
Current practice is to pump the waste gases out of the hospital and release them into the atmosphere. But in St John's four operating theatres, another innovation is being used to reduce those emissions.
Dr Goddard explains the new system captures the excess gases and stops them from escaping.
""The pipe goes into a little canister on the side of the machine and the gases are collected there and held there. When the canister is full an alarm goes off and the team can change the canister very easily in a matter of seconds.""
This team is the only one in the UK currently using this technology and the first in the UK to use this particular device. Dr Goddard says it has the potential to cut the demand for anaesthetic gases too, further reducing their carbon footprint.
""The captured anaesthetic gases can be extracted centrally and purified, and after various approvals can be potentially re-used, so not only are we reducing the amounts being put up into the atmosphere, we're also reducing the requirement for new gases to be manufactured as well.""
""5% is a massive amount so if that's an area we can tackle and reduce the impact it will make a very big difference to the emissions of the NHS overall"".

210,COP26,Matt McGrath,Climate change: Iran says lift sanctions and we'll ratify Paris agreement,2021-11-11,"Iran will ratify the landmark Paris agreement on climate change only if sanctions against it are lifted, a senior leader has told the BBC.
Ali Salajegheh said sanctions were impeding Iran in areas like renewable energy.
Iran is the world's eighth largest CO2 emitter, yet is one of the few countries not to ratify the Paris pact. 
Emissions have soared in recent years as overseas investments in renewable energy have collapsed. 
The government has also violently suppressed protests about water shortages. 
While the country's president Ebrahim Raisi has chosen not to come to the UN climate change summit in Glasgow, the Iranian team is here to plead for relief from the economic blockade.
""Iran has been impacted by climate change like every other place in the world,"" said Mr Salajegheh.
""This has reduced our rainfall per annum and also the inflow of water into our rivers has reduced by 40% this has affected our agriculture and affected our industrial and drinking water.""
However, Iran has been criticised for damaging its own water supply by drilling over a million wells and building around 700 dams. 
On the issue of the Paris climate agreement, Mr Salajegheh said the pact had to be a ""two-way street.""
""When you have oppressive sanctions in force it does not allow for any kind of imports even medicine which is a human fundamental right,"" he said.
""If the sanctions are removed, then we have a commitment towards the international community, it is at that time that they can transfer modern technology and finance to us especially in the area of renewable energy so we can modernise our deteriorating infrastructure,"" he told BBC News.  
But can Iran be trusted on climate change? 
The country had originally said that even if sanctions weren't removed they promised that CO2 would be reduced. 
The reality is somewhat different, carbon pollution has in fact gone up, and the country is rated as ""critically insufficient"" on climate change by the Climate Action Tracker.
The country hasn't submitted a carbon cutting plan since 2015. Experts say their emissions are likely to increase by 50% by 2030.
 ""What happened was we said that we would reduce by 12% if sanctions are removed. The sanctions were not removed,"" said Mr Salajegheh. 
As a country that is massively dependant on oil and gas exports, how will Iran cope in a world that will likely see a shrinking demand for fossil fuels?
""Oil and gas will end one day but if we use it in a way that brings the emissions to the minimum then we can use it as well as renewables,"" Mr Salajegheh said. 
While the rest of the world is engaged in the discussions here on cutting carbon and raising finance for the developing world, there is little room for debates with Iran. 
The country's representatives are here to make a point about sanctions. 
Right now, they say they can't to join the global fight against climate change. But they want this to change. 
""We have come here to say that Iran is a nation engaged with the whole world. We're all part of this global village and can help each other,"" the head of their delegation said. 
 ""When you have an economic terrorism that has blockaded us, we are now saying remove this and we can engage with the world and then rest assured that we will be here.""

211,Climate change,Victoria Gill,Coastal saltmarsh 'engineered' to fight climate change,2021-11-11,"Re-flooding coastal wetlands could provide an opportunity to ""work with nature"" and use sea level rise to fight climate change, scientists say. 
An ongoing study of a coastal marsh in Scotland has shown the potential to lock carbon emissions into mud. 
A stretch of the Skinflats RSPB reserve near Falkirk was restored in 2018. 
""It's now pretty much indistinguishable from the saltmarsh that's been here for hundreds of years,"" said the RSPB's Allison Leonard.
""We carried out lots of surveys and studies before we did it, but then when it actually came to breaching the seawall, it's really quite simple. You get a digger and just go for it.""
Once the water found its way in, Ms Leonard explained ""nature just did its thing"".  
""We're really seeing the wildlife respond,"" she said. 
Prof William Austin from the University of St Andrews, who has been studying the site's natural restoration explained that ""allowing the sea to come back in"" created habitat and an opportunity to store what is known as blue carbon.  
""That's the carbon stored in plants and soils,"" he explained. ""These [saltmarshes] are places that will build up stores of carbon that would otherwise be in the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas.
""We can count the plant species here, we can count the animals, we can look at the wading birds that start to come in and use the site,"" he told BBC News. 
""But as well as nature positive changes, we're starting to see an accumulation in the soil of organic material that is rich in carbon. This is why these habitats are such great interest to us.""
As the COP26 climate summit draws to a conclusion in Glasgow, he suggested that the protection, restoration and even the creation of new wetland habitat could be a valuable part of Scotland's efforts to reach net-zero emissions. 
""These sites take in some of this greenhouse gas for us. So we need to work with nature to achieve that balance of net zero,"" he said. ""But of course, we have to reduce our emissions in the meantime.""

213,COP26,BBC News,COP26: China and US agree to boost climate co-operation,2021-11-11,"China and the US have agreed to boost climate co-operation over the next decade, in a surprise announcement at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.
The world's two biggest CO2 emitters pledged to act in a joint declaration.
It says both sides will ""recall their firm commitment to work together"" to achieve the 1.5C temperature goal set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement.
They called for stepped-up efforts to close the ""significant gap"" that remains to achieve that target.
Scientists say that limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C will help humanity avoid the worst climate impacts. This is compared to pre-industrial temperatures.
At Paris in 2015, world leaders pledged to try to keep the world from warming by more than between 1.5C to 2C through sweeping emissions cuts. 
China's top climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua told reporters that on climate change ""there is more agreement between China and US than divergence"".
US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are expected to hold a virtual meeting as early as next week. The two countries are seen as global rivals on a number of issues.
In Wednesday's rare joint declaration, there were steps agreed on a range of issues including methane emissions, the transition to clean energy, and de-carbonisation.
But China refused to join an agreement earlier this week to limit methane - a harmful greenhouse gas. The agreement was signed by nearly 100 other countries. China has instead pledged to develop a ""national plan"" to address methane. 
Mr Xie was followed by John Kerry, the US climate envoy, who said the US and China ""have no shortage of differences, but on climate, co-operation is the only way to get this job done"".
""Every step matters right now and we have a long journey ahead of us,"" he said.
Perhaps the most important clue as to the significance of this statement is in the last bit of the title - a joint declaration on enhancing climate action in the 2020s.
If the world wants to keep the 1.5C temperature threshold in sight, then the steps taken to limit carbon emissions in the next nine years are absolutely critical.
While China has been reluctant to tackle its domestic coal emissions in the short term, this statement is a recognition of the urgency of action.
So the joint steps agreed - on methane, forests and technology transfer - are important symbolically and also potentially in emissions terms.
The agreement is also a recognition by both sides that there is a massive gap between the efforts of countries to limit emissions to date, and what science says is necessary for a safer world.
Closing that gap means a strong agreement here in Glasgow.
The optics and timing of this statement, regardless of the contents, certainly give that a boost.
Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan welcomed the declaration between China and the US, but warned that both countries needed to show greater commitment to reaching climate goals. 
""Ultimately their statement falls short of the call by the climate vulnerable countries demanding that nations come back to the table every year with greater ambition until the 1.5C gap is closed"", she said. 
EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said it was ""really encouraging"" to see China and the US working together. ""It shows also that the US and China know this subject transcends other issues. And it certainly helps us here at COP to come to an agreement"", he added. 
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the announcement was ""an important step in the right direction."" 
COP26 is the biggest climate change conference since landmark talks in Paris in 2015. Some 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming, by 2030.
In other developments at the COP26 climate summit today:
Last week, US President Joe Biden criticised Chinese President Xi Jinping for not turning up to the summit in person. 
""The fact that China is trying to assert, understandably, a new role in the world as a world leader - not showing up, come on,"" Mr Biden said, adding that Xi Jinping's absence was a ""big mistake"".
China is the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, followed by the US. In September Mr Xi announced that China will aim for carbon neutrality by 2060, with a plan to hit peak emissions before 2030. The US is aiming for net-zero by 2050.

215,Climate change,Katherine Latham,Would the world be better if it was run by teenagers?,2021-11-11,"What would the world be like if it was run by teenagers? One company decided to find out.
UK renewable energy provider, Good Energy, appointed six young people, aged from 12 to 17, to sit on a new advisory board back in March - no adults allowed.
This Good Future Board holds regular meetings, where its members have the opportunity to present ideas to the firm's chief executive and other bosses, and question business decisions.
One of the board members is Shaina Shah,14, who lives in London. She is passionate about the environment, and wants to protect her world for future generations. 
""I think adults can think about money first,"" she says. ""They don't always choose the most sustainable option.""
""[But] young people have grown up in a world where the effects of climate change are clearly visible.""
Shaina adds that she and the other five members of the advisory board are not afraid to tell the adults when they think they're wrong.
They were appointed after more than 1,000 school children across England entered a competition organised via environmental charity Eco-Schools.
Entrants had to write a 500-word personal statement that answered three questions - What inspired you to care for our planet? What skills or experiences you can bring? And - Do you have one idea for how a renewable energy company can do more to help protect the planet?
The six winners were described as ""incredibly passionate, insightful and impressive"".
Jack Solly, 13, is also on the advisory board, having been appointed when he was just 12. He says he jumped at the chance, as he wanted to learn about business and the energy market. He also hopes to use the opportunity to help ""preserve some of the wild places"". 
""This planet is precious,"" says Jack. ""And if we don't look after it then we won't have anywhere to live."" 
He adds that young people's priorities are more focused on the future than those of adults. ""Adults are more focused on the present, on doing their jobs - will their boss be happy? Will they get their promotion? Rather than thinking ahead and considering the long-term impacts of their actions,"" he says.
""Younger people don't have so many pressures and stresses, so are free to look into the future.""
The positions on the advisory board are unpaid, but the members do get their expenses paid for when they attend Good Energy's annual general meeting. And two weekends ago the company paid for them to attend United Nations Climate Change Conference of Youth, held in Glasgow ahead of the COP26 climate summit.
New Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.
Good Energy says that, so far, the advisory board has helped it review its diversity and inclusion strategy, and that ""their feedback on our brand and how we position ourselves has played a big part in a new website we are launching soon"".
The company's chief executive, Nigel Pocklington, adds: ""We wanted to give a diverse group of young people a voice in the [climate] crisis which will impact them more than older generations. They give us new ideas and perspectives which we wouldn't get from experienced business executives.""
Shaina and Jack are both part of Generation Z or Gen Z - young adults and children born between the mid 1990s and the early 2010s.
Gen Z is now the most-populous generation on Earth, according to numerous studies. One such report said that members of Generation Z now account for 2.5 billion people, or 32% of the global population. This is ahead of second place millennials (those born between 1981 and 1995), who make up 22%.
The environment is the biggest concern of members of Gen Z, according to a global survey this year by accountancy group Deloitte. This is followed by unemployment, healthcare and education. 
Maxine Marcus, is the founder of San Francisco-based The Ambassadors Company, which allows brands to survey thousands of teens across the US.
The 21-year-old says the idea for the business ""really fell into my lap"".  ""When I was in middle school, my dad, a venture capitalist,  pulled me out of class to attend my first pitch meeting.
""The companies pitching kept diverting their attention to me, asking about my life and habits. It was then that I realised how critical my voice was.""
So, in 2017, at the age of 17, Ms Marcus recruited school friends and set up The Ambassadors Company. ""I hope I can build something meaningful, a business that can perpetuate long after me,"" she says. ""I grew up in the start-up world - so I'm mentally wired to want to build a unicorn [a privately-owned company valued at more than $1bn [Â£740m].""
The issue of excessive food waste is a topic that concerns many members of Generation Z. And with the World Wildlife Fund estimating that one third of all edible food is thrown away globally, perhaps it should be a bigger topic of discussion for people of all ages.
In the US state of Colorado, Sophie Warren says that when her parents first started beekeeping when she was a young child, she and her older sisters, Chloe and Lily, couldn't bear to see all the beeswax going to waste after the honey had been harvested from the honeycombs.
""We realised there was a significant amount of beeswax left over,"" says Sophie, now 17, ""We didn't want to throw it away because the bees worked super hard to make it. So, instead of wasting it, we made lip balms out of it.""
In 2009 when Sophie was just five, Chloe, seven, and Lily, nine, the three sisters (with a bit of help from mum and dad) set up a cosmetics company - Sweet Bee Sisters - to sell the lip balm.
The firm now sells a range of skincare products, and the siblings hope that their example will inspire other children and young adults to become environmentally-minded entrepreneurs.
""We want other strong leaders to come up alongside us,"" says Sophie. ""We believe that our generation will be world changers."" 
Back at Good Energy, fellow advisory board member, Mahnoor Kamran, 17, from Stoke-on-Trent, says that the group debate the firm's ""business policies, environmental policies and ethics"".
""For us [on the panel], it's not about short-term gains and profit,"" she says. ""For young people, it is about our future -who gets to live, and who suffers. I think we will always put the planet over profit in every situation.""

216,COP26,glas Fraser,Transport route change or reverse gear?,2021-11-10,"Some see the great energy transition as a humongous cost and an existential threat to their businesses. For others, it's an opportunity. For transport, it's both.
The tensions are to be seen in the sizeable gaps in the COP26 declaration issued on the day when transport has been most in focus. The UK got fewer than 40 countries to sign up to a promise to stop selling petrol or diesel-powered cars by 2040, and 2035 for ""leading economies"".
That's an easy one for Europeans who have already committed to dates ahead of then.  It's also easy for some car manufacturers, such as Volvo, which are on track towards all-electric offerings.
But others are conspicuously absent, including the USA, China and Germany.  Among manufacturers, there was an absence of Toyota and Volkswagen, the world's two biggest. 
They have hybrid and plug-in options and are expanding that range, but VW does not want to commit to going all-battery in its North American markets if its batteries are being powered up by coal and gas-burning power stations. 
That doesn't achieve much in terms of carbon emissions, so it wants to pass the pressure back onto governments and regulators to sort out the power sector first.
For the auto industry, the move to a different ""power train"", as they like to term it, is a big business opportunity, currently offering big premium prices. Manufacturers do not seem to anticipate much slow-up of the growing number of cars hitting the road. 
And that's despite the making of all a car's components having a carbon footprint, and congestion being a continued problem. 
With that in mind, the Sustainable Transport Alliance pitched in to the COP26 debate on the future of road transport, by pointing out that ever more cars, however they're powered, will mean more congestion.
They also require a lot of energy and materials in their construction and delivery to their users. 
Representing cycling, walking and public transport groups, the alliance wants to see countries shift away from electrifying cars to reducing their number, while making other forms of transport more attractive and less congested.
Stagecoach, the Perth-based transport firm, joined the corporate lobby-fest at the Glasgow gathering with a plea for more bus service support. And as those attending the UN blue zone were taken to and from the city centre on electric buses, the call was stepped up for free public transport across Glasgow and beyond, in a way that cities such as Luxembourg have pioneered. 
What is becoming clear as COP26 draws to its conclusion is that there is a splintering of multi-lateral agreements. ""Coalitions of the willing"" are setting out bolder intentions than those who have more to lose.
That goes for a declaration on heavy goods vehicles. There was only a small group, including the UK and US, who signed up to a shipping agreement on the gathering's transport day, with a small number of maritime trade routes designated for net zero status by the middle of this decade. Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions, roughly the same as aviation.
And while they face a tough battle against both the environmental movement and government pressure to reduce their greenhouse gas impact, leading figures in the aviation industry turned their attention to securing bigger, more reliable supply of sustainable aviation fuels, made from plants and used cooking oil - as previewed a month ago at Glasgow Airport. 
A large part of the great energy transition features the chicken and egg challenge of providing infrastructure and supply of new fuels while also providing a market for them. The market doesn't develop until the supply chain is there. 
That's where governments are being urged to step in, with funding of the infrastructure and development of new technologies to a commercial scale, so that the demand can then be built up.
Getting closer to home, that ""infrastructure first"" approach is a feature of a new planning framework set out in draft by the Scottish government to focus on homes and the built environment.Â  
If implemented, the framework should make it easier to develop renewable energy capacity, such as wind turbines and solar arrays, and the infrastructure that links them up, as well as encouraging more local, district heating and energy hubs.
It steps cautiously across the issue of road capacity expansion, emphasising only that roads will need improved charging or hydrogen fuelling points. Highland MSPs want to see the big routes such as the A9 dualled, but that might prove unpopular now there are Green party ministers round the table.   
Development of homes is to be focused on communities where people are able to walk to shops, services and public transport within 20 minutes. New developments will face obstacles if they encourage more use of private cars.
Many of the projects included in the framework are already well down the tracks of construction. Some, such as high speed rail linking Scotland with England, are much further up the tracks.
But one nod in the direction of Scottish government's preference for an independent nation to re-join the European Union is an expectation, in the framework, that east coast ports would have to take much more freight and passenger traffic.

From Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the hunt for Irn Bru, Barack Obama's trip to the student union or Leonardo DiCaprio dining out on the town - COP26 has brought some of the world's biggest names to Scotland.
As well as bringing a touch of glamour to proceedings, the celebrities used their profiles to shine a light on environmental projects close to their hearts.

President Obama grabbed all the headlines with his summit speech on Monday, when he called on young people to ""stay angry"" in the fight against climate change. 
And he highlighted the plight of island nations which are already suffering due to climate crisis. They are ""in many ways the canary in the coal mine,"" he said. 
But he didn't avoid gaffes. Apparently unsure of his geography, he referred to being in the ""Emerald Isles"" and described Shakespeare as ""the Bard"" - in Scotland, that title is reserved for Robert Burns.
It didn't affect his reception at a visit to the University of Strathclyde later however. Ahead of a meeting with COP26 youth leaders at the student union, he received a rapturous reception. The union gave the former president a lifetime membership to mark the occasion.
US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has been chronicling her trip to Scotland on Instagram, set social media alight on Wednesday during her COP26 visit with an appeal to taste Irn Bru.
The Democrat - who is known as AOC - had attended an event on gender and the climate crisis with Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi.
Responding to questions from followers on social media, she said her schedule was ""jammed"" but she hoped to see more of Scotland during. 
""I want to find some Irn Bru, touch Harris Tweed and see a castle,"" she said.
Later, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted a photo of herself and Ms Ocasio-Cortez, saying she now had a ""supply"" of the fizzy drink.
Irn-Bru met with her approval, with the New York Representative saying it reminded her of Kola Champagne - another ""soda"" popular in Latin America.
The Titanic actor and environmental campaigner is a UN climate change representative. He attended the Kew Carbon Garden exhibit in the first week of the conference.
The night before he was spotted at a fringe event, posing with film producer Paul Goodenough, founder of charity Rewriting Extinction. He also dined out in the city's popular Finnieston area.
DiCaprio has donated millions to environmental organisations and backed ventures such as those producing trainers made from natural materials.
The 46-year-old was recently photographed flying commercially rather than by private jet.  It is believed he also travelled to Scotland with a commercial airline.
The British actor is a goodwill ambassador for the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). He addressed the COP26 summit last Saturday, admitting in his speech that he understands why ""people might be a little irritated"" to see celebrities weighing in on climate change.
The star of the TV shows Luther and The Wire, and films including Avengers: Infinity War and Fast & Furious: Hobbs & Shaw said he believed he could amplify the conversation around food supply and climate change saying: ""One thing I've got is a big mouth.""
The 49-year-old discussed the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the supply chain, especially on families who were forced to queue for food due to food shortages.
The 31-year-old Harry Potter star hosted a panel discussion with several climate change campaigners including Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate at the New York Times Climate Hub. 
On her Instagram account, she said of the experience: ""There is no doubt in my mind that we witnessed a piece of history in Glasgow. I would feel honoured to be in the presence of just one of these women individually (they are all actual superstars who are quite literally making the world a better place) - but to be with them altogether - was almost overwhelming.""
While in Glasgow, the actor hid books around the city as part of the book fairies movement. She chose titles related to climate activism for the week-long Book Fairies event.
One of the lucky places where she left several was the Heart of Scotstoun community centre in the west end, where the ""fairy"" was snapped with staff.
Fashion designer Stella McCartney brought her vision of the future of fashion to Glasgow with a showcase at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. Her mission is to make fashion more sustainable.
McCartney has never used leather, feathers, skin or fur in her designs and she showed Prince Charles around her exhibit which showcased the innovative materials she is introducing to the fashion world.
These included Bolt Threads' Mylo mycelium leather, regenerative cotton from Soktas and Econyl regenerated nylon sourced from waste and ocean plastics. 
The designer also showcased the world's first vegan football boots, that she created with footballer Paul Pogba and Adidas.
Musician Ellie Goulding spent a day in Glasgow with friend and fellow activist Princess Eugenie. 
The 34-year-old singer last year signed an open letter to the UK government calling for more women in decision-making roles at COP26 .
The letter, which was also signed by actor Emma Watson, said the gender balance was ""incomprehensible"".
Goulding posted to her Instagram account, saying: ""Our future generations shouldn't have to inherit a broken planet because we didn't take the opportunity to fix it when we could! Let's go""
Academy award-winner Matt Damon did not visit Glasgow in person, but took part virtually from New York in a panel discussion about water supply in developing countries.
The 51-year-old is co-founder of Water.org, a charity which brings water and sanitation to deprived communities. 
The actor travelled with his mother as a child and saw first-hand extreme poverty in developing countries.
While filming a movie in Africa in 2006, he spent time with families in a Zambian village and after seeing how they lacked access to water and toilets, he founded H20 Africa Foundation to raise awareness about safe water initiatives on the continent.
Supermodel, actor and activist Lily Cole was spotted at Glasgow Green on Saturday after about 100,000 people marched in the biggest protest of the climate summit.
She also hosted an event with indigenous communities which Prince Charles attended. Her focus is on helping indigenous people affected by climate change to have a voice.
The star has written a book, Who Cares Wins: How to Protect the Planet You Love and told BBC Women's Hour that she was choosing to be optimistic because the data in the climate change situation is terrifying.
She said: ""I think there are so many solutions, policies, technologies, value systems and wisdoms that we can tap into to find a way through and only by focusing on solutions will we actually overcome the obstacles we need to""
He might not have the same star power of Obama or DiCaprio, but TV chaser Mark 'the Beast' Labbett arrived in Glasgow to attend a pub quiz during week one of COP26.
The star of The Chase was pictured at Central Station adopting a climate-friendly mode of travel. He was not taking part in COP26 events, but made the day of two British Transport Police officers from Nottingham in Glasgow to help keep the city safe.

220,Climate change,BBC News,COP26: 'Children are really concerned about their future',2021-11-10,"Pupils at a school which has established an eco committee ""are really concerned about their future"", a teacher said.
Darlinghurst Academy, in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, has been recognised for its climate change work and has appointed monitors to check energy use.
The school has been awarded the Green Flag, the highest award in the global Eco-Schools programme.
Teacher Emma Powell said the children ""want to act"" on climate change.
Ms Powell, the head of science and an accredited UN climate change teacher, teaches a climate change unit where pupils learn what could be done to protect the environment and tackle global warming.
The pupils also carry out litter picking in the school grounds and the surrounding area and then sort items for recycling, including soft plastics.
Last month, two eco-committee members took part in a national children's parliament event, with 600 other school pupils, to discuss COP26 Glasgow climate summit.
To be awarded the Green Flag, the school must work on things such as reducing energy usage and improving biodiversity, as well as not using glitter in school.
Ms Powell said the pupils ""are really concerned about their future, about climate change, about pollution, about the damage that humans are causing to the environment"".
She added: ""It's my job to make sure their voices are heard.
""As a school we're doing everything we can to make small changes to protect their future.""

222,COP26,Ben Schofield and Craig Lewis,COP26: Facing up to the challenge of retrofitting homes,2021-11-10,"Making houses greener is an important government target if the pledges coming out of COP26 are to be achieved, but just how big is the challenge of retrofitting our homes? 
People in Northampton, says Laura Elliott, are on board with the idea of energy-efficient, eco-friendly homes.
She is a project manager for Northampton Partnership Homes (NPH), which manages West Northamptonshire Council's social housing stock.
NPH is currently working to retrofit 150 homes in the town to make them as environmentally friendly as possible.
While such projects aim to be a first step along a path to help realise the government's pledge of reaching net-zero carbon by 2050, it is not always easy.
Emma Ratcliffe has lived in her ""not very warm"" two-bedroom home in Northampton for nine years.
""The windows are old,"" she says. ""These are very old houses, with old heating systems.
""I'm paying for heat that's going straight back out through the gaps in doors and windows.""
She is full of praise for the retrofitting scheme which she says will save her between Â£50 and Â£70 a week, and is ""good for the carbon footprint as well"".
Northampton's Whole House Retrofit Project will cost around Â£7.5m, with Â£3m coming from the government.
The scheme targets homes built in the 1920s, which are expensive to heat and relatively energy inefficient.
Residents will benefit from improved insulation, solar panels, upgraded central heating systems and better ventilation - all resulting in lower energy bills and greater energy efficiency.
About Â£60,000 will be spent on each of the 150 homes.
Laura Elliott says it is about taking ""a whole house approach"".
""The intention is to make the homes much more comfortable for our residents,"" she says.
""The heat of these properties leaks through the walls at the moment.
""By insulating it we stop that, and stop the demand for heating.""
Across the county border at a 400-year-old thatched property in Great Stukeley in Cambridgeshire, Anne Murphy says ""watching COP26 and some of the more impressive youngsters - they prod my conscience a little bit"".
However, she says retrofitting her four-bedroom cottage comes with its own challenges.
That's not to say she's not a willing convert to the idea of creating an eco-friendly home.
""We've all got to do our bit,"" she says. ""I'm looking at things like draft excluders, the letterbox and back door.
""I'd definitely welcome advice on alternative forms of heating to the oil burner.""
She has already had work completed on the property, including double glazing and loft insulation.
The home's oil central heating is one challenge - ""clearly I can't go to gas"" - while she says she has been told the age of the property means a heat pump would not be effective, because the device works by transferring thermal energy from a cooler space to a warmer space using a refrigeration cycle.
""They believe it would be difficult to use,"" she says. ""It needs completely insulated rooms and none of mine are because of the age of the doors - the ill-fit of the doors.
""They give it character, but don't help if you are trying to keep a room entirely insulated.""
Cambridge Carbon Footprint is an organisation which ""works to raise awareness of climate change issues and to support people in moving to low-carbon living"".
""We help people and organisations cut back their carbon footprints,"" says Tom Bragg, one of its members.
He says there is currently very little support out there, either financially or in information terms, for those who want to make their homes eco-friendly. 
""We've really got to find a way to up our game,"" he says.
""The key thing in most homes is to get them well insulated and then look if you can improve the source of heating.
""There are about 20 million older homes in Britain that need some sort of retrofit improvement.
""It's an enormous problem and we are scratching the surface at the moment.""
He says some of the biggest issues are a lack of trained people to evaluate homes and fit them out correctly, and the cost to owners.
""Cost is a barrier,"" he says.
""For most homes there are some simple low-cost measures like draft-proofing or turning down your thermostat, but we will need government help.""
Back in Northampton, Paul Tucker, NPH's sustainability manager, has high hopes that their retrofitting scheme will have a major effect.
""In terms of the carbon footprint, we expect theses changes should reduce it by something like 70%,"" he says.
""They'll not quite be zero carbon houses, but we could almost call them zero carbon ready.
""With improvements in grid electricity over the next few decades they'll become really, really efficient homes.""
Mr Tucker says NPH currently looks after 12,000 homes. 
After the work on the 150 homes is finished, he says the plan is to retrofit ""around three times as many"" next year, before ""gradually ramping it up"" to tackle their entire housing stock.
""This is quite a small start to what is a long journey,"" he says.
A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) says: ""Huge progress is already being made in improving the energy efficiency of UK homes, and we are investing almost Â£6.6bn to support people to install energy efficiency measures to help reduce monthly energy bills.
""We have set out plans to support low income households in particular, ensuring they are some of the earliest to benefit from the move to net zero.""

224,COP26,Tom Espiner,COP 26: Four major carmakers fail to back zero emissions pledge,2021-11-10,"Four of the world's biggest carmakers have failed to sign a COP 26 summit pledge to only sell zero emissions cars and vans by 2035.
Volkswagen, Toyota, Renault-Nissan and Hyundai-Kia were not among signatories to the climate summit declaration.
China and US, which are the world's biggest car markets, were also absent from the list of signatories.
Big car manufacturers that did sign up included Ford, General Motors, and Jaguar Land Rover.
The declaration, which was made at the COP 26 climate summit in Glasgow, called on signatories to speed up the global transition from cars that burn fossil fuels to zero emissions vehicles, which include electric cars and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.
The agreement signed by governments and city authorities across the world commits signatories to ending the sale of new cars that produce emissions in ""leading markets"" by 2035, and globally by 2040.
Investors and banks said they would support the transition, and some fleet owners pledged to make their car and van fleets green.
Some major carmakers were signatories, including Ford, General Motors, Jaguar Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo.
Governments that signed up included Canada, Denmark, India, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, and the UK - although Britain has already said it will ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030.
Some US cities and states put their names to the list, including New York and California.
Investors including Aviva and NatWest, and fleet owners including supermarkets Sainsbury's and Tesco also signed up.
While some parts of the US such as Dallas, Los Angeles and New York City signed up, the US itself, which is the biggest car market, remained off the list.
China, which is the second-largest car market, was also absent. Germany, the largest car market in the EU, did not sign up.
The world's largest car manufacturers, VW and Toyota, were not on the list, alongside rival car giants Renault-Nissan and Hyundai-Kia.
Volkswagen, which recently unveiled its ID.5 electric SUV, said that while it was creating electrified products, the environmental benefits of signing up to the pledge were not clear-cut when electricity production in the US and China is still heavily reliant on burning fossil fuels.
A spokesman said major markets relying on fossil fuels to produce electricity means ""the argument isn't there"" for pledging to only sell electric and other zero emissions cars by 2035, adding: ""We are just being realistic.""
""We believe that an accelerated shift to electro mobility has to go in line with an energy transition towards 100% renewables,"" the car giant said in a statement.
""The Volkswagen Group, representing business activities in all major markets worldwide, decided not to sign the declaration at this point in time.""
Toyota, which put its first commercially produced electric cars on the road in 1997, said it will ""provide the most suitable vehicles, including zero emission products, in response to the diverse economic environments, clean energy and charging infrastructure readiness, industrial policies, and customer needs in each country and region"".
Transport in the EU and the US accounts for about a third of carbon dioxide emissions from those locations, which is one of the greenhouse gases contributing to global warming.
Of that total, in the EU, about 70% comes from road transportation.
For this declaration in Glasgow to have been a breakthrough, it needed the backing of major governments and car manufacturers, Professor David Bailey of the University of Birmingham Business School said.
""Without the US, China and Germany on board, we are not going to get vehicle emissions where we need to be by 2050,"" Professor Bailey said, adding that the big car makers also need to be ""on board"".
He said that the US ""has a penchant for big pick-up"" trucks that will need to be electrified eventually, but a 2035 target for new sales would not gain popular support for US President Joe Biden.
The car industry in Germany is split between car electrification and wanting to use synthetic fuels, while China is heavily reliant on coal, and building more coal power stations.
China setting zero emissions vehicles sales targets would beg the question about why it was not committing to more electricity generation from renewables, he added.
The UK launched the Zero Emission Vehicle Transition Council (ZEVTC), a group of 30 countries that ""have agreed to work together to make zero emission vehicles the new normal"", the government said.
It also announced that all new heavy goods vehicles will be zero emission by 2040, with HGVs of 26 tonnes and under being phased out from 2035.
Industry body the Road Haulage Association said that it was ""concerned about the timing of phasing out some sizes of new trucks from 2035"".
The RHA's managing director of policy and public affairs, Rod McKenzie said:
""We support the government's aim to decarbonise but the pace may be impossibly fast. Care is needed to ensure that all markets are served and future disruption to the supply chains are avoided.
""We would like the deadline extended for lorries over 18 tonnes by five years with support for hauliers in making the transition.
""Proven alternatives to diesel for all uses, locations, ranges and the heaviest trucks don't yet exist. It will require continuous review of the timeline over coming years to ensure a sustainable and successful transition to zero tailpipe lorries.""
The UK also announced a new design for electric vehicle charge points ""which could become as iconic as the Great British post box, London bus or black cab"" it said.

225,COP26,BBC News,My Day at COP26: 'I'm painting murals so people don't forget COP happened here',2021-11-10,"Daniel Rupaszov, 25, from Hungary, belongs to a group of artists and activists who visit COP every year to create art which highlights the climate crisis. In the latest in a series of first-person accounts from the Glasgow summit, Daniel talks about the murals he is painting around the city.
Our collective, the Artivist Network, has been coming to COP for years now - wherever it is held. We'll set up a space, provide free materials and help activists make banners, carnival puppets and other artwork ready for demonstrations. Our catchphrase is ""Create, Connect, Disrupt"".
Every year we also find a space to paint a mural during COP, to leave something permanent and thought-provoking behind after the negotiations - so people don't forget that this happened in their city.
Our first iconic project was at COP nearly six years ago, when the Paris Accords were agreed. Two years ago, in Madrid, we painted a 45m-long (148ft) mural on a university building - that was really exciting because the students there were really radical. Before that we painted a mural in Bonn, and one in Katowice the year before that.
I've been in Glasgow for about two weeks now and I've been looking for a space to paint a mural here. We had quite a few offers, and so I'm going to paint three murals over the next few days with support from Friends of the Earth Scotland.
Today I'm on Hayburn Street in Partick, less than two miles from where the COP negotiations are taking place, painting at a location that I chose because it's next to a zero-waste shop.
My Day at COP26:
This location is really in harmony with the theme I am painting about - recycling. Recycling is something that makes people in Western societies feel more comfortable about their consumption. But loads of our plastic waste ends up being dumped in landfills in Asia - leaving them to deal with the problem. 
This mural is a mixed-media piece and I'm creating it using acrylic wall paint, spray paint and a large poster. It's about 5 metres square (54 sq ft) - not monumental, but still eye-catching.
I don't like to rush when I'm doing these paintings. People want to come and chat and if they get to meet the artists and talk to them, and understand why this painting is being made and what the concept is, they'll feel the mural belongs to them much more. That is really important to me.
Where I live, in Hungary, I don't feel the government is taking the climate crisis seriously at all - they're really going in the wrong direction. Scotland is very progressive with their aims leading up to 2050, they seem like a country which is heading in the right direction - but you can never do enough.
I was raised on the outskirts of Budapest in a Scottish family - my mother is Scottish and I was born in Glasgow. Half of my family lives here, so I came to Scotland very often as a child, and still do.
As told to Sarah McDermott
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

226,COP26,Matt McGrath,COP26: Draft deal calls for stronger carbon cutting targets by end of 2022,2021-11-10,"Countries are being urged to strengthen their carbon-cutting targets by the end of 2022 in a draft agreement published at the COP26 Glasgow climate summit.
The document says vulnerable nations must get more help to cope with the deadly impacts of global warming.
It also says countries should submit long-term strategies for reaching net-zero by the end of next year. 
Critics have said the draft pact does not go far enough but others welcomed its focus on the 1.5C target.
The document, which has been published by the UK COP26 presidency, will have to be negotiated and agreed by countries attending the talks. 
COP26 president Alok Sharma said he expected ""near final texts"" to be published overnight, adding that the agreement that comes out of the conference would ""set the future for our children and grandchildren"".
Scientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5C - beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt - requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030 and to zero overall by mid-century.
With the world off track to meet the goal, the draft document urges countries to ""revisit and strengthen"" the targets for cutting emissions by 2030 in their national plans to align them with the Paris Agreement goal of well below 2C or 1.5C by the end of 2022.
Loss and damage - an issue of key importance to the developing world - has been included in the draft, calling for more support from developed countries and other organisations to address the damage caused by extreme weather and rising seas in vulnerable nations. 
It also recognises that more finance is needed for developing countries beyond the long-promised $100bn a year by 2020, which will not be delivered until at least 2022.
But campaigners say these parts of the text are weak and essentially a ""box ticking exercise"".
The document also calls on countries to accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels - but has no firm dates or targets on this issue.
It also asks UN secretary general Antonio Guterres to convene world leaders in 2023 to consider how efforts to reach targets for 2030 are shaping up.
Some 200 countries are meeting at COP to try to keep the lid on rising temperatures. Today, a document that forms the basis of what they could sign up to in Glasgow has been released by the hosts of the conference, the UK presidency.
It sums up everything that has been discussed so far, but is very much a draft.
There are bits missing and a number of contentious issues, which could get strengthened or watered down over the next few days.
The reference to phasing out fossil fuels will undoubtedly be opposed by some nations. 
And countries vulnerable to the most destructive effects of climate change will want assurances that more money is coming their way to help protect their people against rising sea levels, drought and storms.
At COP26 nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and getting a consensus among so many countries is never easy.
COP veterans expect ""one hell of a fight"" ahead - with all to play for in the next few days.
The World Wide Fund for Nature said the call for enhanced 2030 targets and references to phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, among other proposals, ""must stick"". 
Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, WWF Global Lead Climate & Energy said it was essential ministers worked to include ""a clear plan to close the 2030 ambition gap and the timeframe to do this"", adding that the draft text ""must be a floor not a ceiling"". 
But there have been warnings that there would be opposition to the idea of coming back with new plans next year.
David Waskow, from the World Resources Institute, said: ""The Saudis and Russians have been quite clear on that, others have been less blunt.""
He added many of the other countries pushing back were vulnerable and either did not produce a large percentage of global emissions or had ""very limited resources to develop nationally-determined contributions and then to implement them"".
The Alliance of Small Island States, whose members are among the nations least responsible for climate change, said the text needed to be strengthened in ""key areas"" to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable countries, particularly on finance.
And Jennifer Morgan, from Greenpeace International, said the draft deal was ""not a plan to solve the climate crisis"" but an agreement that ""we'll all cross our fingers and hope for the best"".  
Labour's shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said Prime Minister Boris Johnson needed to ""take charge of a summit that is not on track to deliver"". 
""We are miles off where we need to be in the halving of emissions required by 2030,"" he said.
""It's time the government faced this truth, stopped the greenwash, and put maximum pressure on all parties to step up and agree a path out of Glasgow to keep 1.5 alive.""
In a video made on the train up to Glasgow as the UK prime minister returned to COP26, Boris Johnson said all countries had made ""significant progress"" in the last few days but there was ""still a long way to go"".
No 10 said that Mr Johnson spoke with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia earlier on Wednesday about the country's climate pledges and the need to make ""progress in negotiations"" taking place in Glasgow.
Saudi Arabia was among a number of countries asking the UN to play down the need to move rapidly away from fossil fuels, according to leaked documents. 
A Downing Street spokesman said: ""They discussed the importance of making progress in negotiations in the final days of COP26, including on finalising the outstanding elements of the Paris rulebook.
""The prime minister said all countries needed to come to the table with increased ambition if we are to keep the target of limiting global warming to 1.5C alive.""
Research published at the summit on Tuesday indicated the short-term plans put in place by countries would see a rise of 2.4C.
While about 140 nations have pledged to reach net zero emissions by around the middle of the century, scientists have said their short-term plans for 2030 are not strong enough to limit the rise in temperatures.

227,COP26,Matt McGrath,Horse trading set to begin over agreement at COP26,2021-11-10,"The UK presidency team have set out an ambitious stall in their first attempt to capture progress here at COP26.
As well as the specific items mentioned in the document, it also gives us a sense of how the negotiations are going more generally.
It's clear that there's a sense of urgency, and a willingness to go high on the key question of cutting carbon more rapidly.
If this idea survives the next couple of days, then Glasgow may well be seen as a success.
But there's a long way to go until the final gavel comes down.
The idea of getting countries to come back more regularly started with the most vulnerable nations.
This meeting floated the idea of countries coming back with new plans every year - and this draft nods to that by asking everyone to come back next year with a new nationally determined contribution (NDC), which outlines their pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
But there are some interesting wrinkles in that request.
Parties are urged to come back in 2022 with plans that ""align with the Paris temperature goal"".
Which one do they mean - 1.5C or 2C?
That will need clarifying in the hours and days ahead. 
The UK have attempted to copper-fasten the idea of rapid improvement in national plans by asking all countries to attend a high-level ministerial meeting on climate change every year.
They've also asked the UN Secretary-General to convene a world leaders meeting in 2023, just ahead of a global stock-take, which will examine how countries are performing on restricting emissions.
That all sounds like a nice day out for presidents and prime ministers, but doesn't commit them to do anything.
There is also some quite progressive language in this draft decision that will hearten campaigners, specifically the mention of coal. 
According to seasoned observer this is the first mention of the ""c"" word in a UN climate change document. 
However, before everyone gets carried away, the give and take nature of the drafting process means that there is no end date given, meaning it is an aspiration and not a timeline. 
The same paragraph also mentions the phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies, but there's no specific mention of oil and gas.
Is that to try and keep Saudi Arabia, Russia and other major producers on board?
There is some nice language on doubling the amount of finance given for adaptation. 
But there's no baseline against which to measure the increase and no timeline for delivery.
The issue of loss and damage finally gets its own significant section in the draft decision. This is the idea that rich nations bear a historical responsibility for global warming and should compensate poorer ones for the harms visited on them. 
Its inclusion will hearten many developing nations, which have been asking for a clear financial commitment to tackle the impacts of climate change that they can't adapt to. However, the document is very woolly on this question.
Now that the UK has played its main negotiating card, much will likely change over the next two days of hardball negotiations.
There will be pressure from countries like Saudi Arabia, Russia, China and India to water down the idea of coming back next year with a new plan.
Strangely there are many developing nations who might also oppose this - the time, effort and costs associated with a new NDC should not be underestimated. 
Developing nations will also seek more clarity on two key issues. 
They will want a strengthening of the language around finance so that a new goal for 2025 represents a significant increase on the much derided $100bn. 
They will also want to see a stronger emphasis on spending up to half that money on adaptation.
The other question is over the loss and damage issue.
Right now, the UN's response to this amounts to a single website for countries affected. 
Emerging economies will want to see this strengthened in the draft decision, with a new secretariat dedicated to the question - and most importantly a separate stream of funding. 
The serious horse trading has already started.

229,Climate change,BBC News,Search for lost village Ravenser Odd to aid coastal erosion research,2021-11-10,"A group of scientists has launched a search for the site of a medieval village swallowed by the sea about 600 years ago.
Ravenser Odd, on the East Yorkshire coast, was one of many settlements lost to coastal erosion since Roman times.
A team from the University of Hull is using sonar in a bid to locate the remains of the town.
They hope the results will help them to predict future coastal erosion as sea levels rise.
Prof Dan Parsons said: ""Sea levels have been very steady for the past 10,000 years now human action has changed our coastal environment.""
He said erosion in more recent times had been ""accelerated"" and the research was fundamental to ""predicting and mitigating the sea level rises baked into our climate system"".
Ravenser Odd, near Spurn Point, was founded in the 13th Century and became a thriving Humber port.
Over the course of about 100 years some of the town's buildings were lost to erosion before it was completely destroyed in the 1360s. 
A recent sea surge in December 2013 inundated the narrowest part of the Spurn peninsula and removed a stretch of road.
Prof Parsons said the coastline in the area was ""really dynamic"" as Spurn Point sits at the end of the eroding coast. 
The experts hope using a sonar system will map the seabed near Spurn and find the village's remains.
Dr Steve Simmons, of the university, said using sonar would ""build up a very detailed picture of the seafloor"".
""We should get some good images. Whether we find what we are looking for is yet to be seen"", he added.

231,Climate change,BBC News,Suffolk County Council pledges Â£12.8m to decarbonise buildings,2021-11-10,"A council has agreed to invest millions of pounds into reducing carbon emissions at more than 130 of its buildings.
Libraries, fire stations, council offices, children's homes and archive facilities are among the buildings Suffolk County Council has pledged to decarbonise.
The authority's cabinet agreed to the Â£12.8m investment on Tuesday.
Among the planned measures are new solar panels and replacing boilers.
Richard Rout, Conservative cabinet member for finance and the environment, said it was ""abundantly clear"" more investment was needed to meet net zero targets.
""The council has a portfolio of wide-ranging buildings including offices and fire stations in both urban and rural locations. Each have different characteristics, infrastructure, operational needs and users.
""We will need to make sure each building gets the most effective solution to specific requirements,"" he said.
Other measures include continuing the rollout of LED lights and reviews of heating and ventilation controls, the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) said.
Improved thermal efficiency and behavioural changes are also planned.
Work on a new electricity contract, due to begin from April, will switch procurement from nuclear means to solar, wind, hydro and other clean renewable sources, the cabinet report said.
The council also reduced heat and power costs from Â£7m in 2018/19 to Â£6.6m last year through existing work, it said.
Andrew Stringer, leader of the opposition Green, Liberal Democrat and Independent group, said he hoped to see maintained schools become a part of the programme, and hoped it would encourage others to work towards their own decarbonisation programmes.

232,Climate change,BBC News,River Thames: Sharks and seahorses found living in waterway,2021-11-10,"Sharks, seahorses, eels and seals have been found living in the River Thames, a study has found.
The State of the Thames Report, led by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), highlights changes since the river was declared ""biologically dead"" in 1957.  
The river has seen an increase in its range of birds, marine mammals and natural habitats since the 1990s.
However, a number of fish species found in the tidal areas of the Thames have showed a slight decline, experts found.
Conservation scientists said further research was needed to determine the cause.
Climate change has increased the temperature of London's waterway by 0.2C a year, the study said. The rising temperature has meant water levels in the tidal Thames have increased since 1911, ZSL said.
Sea levels at Silvertown have also been rising 4.26mm a year since 1990, the report shows.
The report said shark species including tope, starry smooth hound and spurdog live in the Thames and the there are more than 100 species of fish in the 215-mile long river.
It added short-term trends revealed water quality has improved, with dissolved oxygen concentrations showing an increase from 2007 to 2020. 
Alison Debney, for ZSL, said: ""Estuaries are one of our neglected and threatened ecosystems. 
""They provide us with clean water, protection from flooding, and are an important nursery for fish and other wildlife. The Thames Estuary and its associated 'blue carbon' habitats are critically important in our fight to mitigate climate change and build a strong and resilient future for nature and people.  
""This report has enabled us to really look at how far the Thames has come on its journey to recovery since it was declared biologically dead, and, in some cases, set baselines to build from in the future."" 
The Thames is a huge part of what makes London unique - and it plays a big part in the lives of many Londoners.
This first major report into the state of the Thames Estuary in 60 years is bittersweet.
There have been huge improvements since parts were declared biologically dead in 1957; there are now 115 fish and 92 bird species. There are seahorses, eels, seals and even sharks. 
Oxygen levels are improving but nitrates from sewage are getting worse - although that will hopefully improve when the ""super sewer"" opens in 2025.
But the real concern is the effects of climate change. Sea levels are increasing by 4mm a year and the temperature of the Thames is increasing by 0.2C a year.â¯
Those changes could heavily impact the estuary's wildlife.
The report also highlights the need for the Thames Tideway Tunnel, also known as London's super sewer.
The Â£4.2bn, 15-mile (24km) long, 200ft (61m) deep sewer will capture 39 million tonnes of untreated sewage that is currently flushed into the Thames every year.
""[The sewer] will have a significant impact on the water quality, making it a much healthier environment for wildlife to survive and flourish,"" said Liz Wood-Griffiths, from Tideway.
ZSL said it was working closely with partners to create new estuarine habitats, including seagrass and saltmarsh ones.
""Between them, these not only help to restore wildlife in the river, but also act as natural flood defences, and help to mitigate against extreme weather such as storms and floods,"" ZSL said.

233,COP26,BBC News,COP26: PMâs summit plea and axing trees to save water,2021-11-10,"Here are five things you need to know about the COP26 climate change conference on Wednesday.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is urging nations to ""pull out all the stops"" as the first draft of an agreement on how countries will cut emissions to avoid temperatures rising by more than 1.5C is published. He's returning to COP26 in Glasgow as the climate summit nears the end and will meet with ministers and negotiators to find out what progress has been made and where gaps remain. ""There's still much to do,"" says Mr Johnson, however ""negotiating teams are doing the hard yards in these final days of COP26 to turn promises into action on climate change"". Follow our updates here.
In a seemingly odd counter-intuitive battle to limit the impact of climate change, trees are being cut down to save a city from drought. In Cape Town it's three years since the South African city edged dangerously towards what was described as ""Day Zero"" - the moment when some four million inhabitants would be left without water when drought turned all the local reservoirs into dustbowls. Now to protect those reservoirs tens of thousands of trees are being chopped down on the mountains surrounding them. Read more here.
There's a new movement ""exploding right now, and it makes sense,"" says Lou Palmer-Masterton, the owner of three vegan restaurants. She's referring to carbon labelling on menus and food packaging, which show the impact a product has had on the environment with a carbon dioxide - CO2 - emissions score. Given a growing number of companies are using the label, should it be added to all products? We've investigated.
She spends much of her day at a socially-distanced desk existing on a diet of carbon-counted sarnies and Irn-Bru in the Press Centre. Helen Briggs, BBC science journalist, says the best way to describe COP26 is by imagining a never-ending airport terminal. There are countless languages and various outfits from the sleek suit and bright saris, she tells us in her account of what life is like behind the scenes of the summit.
While discussions are under way about tackling climate change at COP26, photographers have captured the effects of global warming for the annual Environmental Photographer Of The Year competition. Rising sea levels, fires and drought feature, with the winning entry by Spanish photographer Antonio AragÃ³n Renuncio showing a child sleeping inside a house destroyed by coastal erosion, highlighting rising sea levels in West African countries.

The world is heading for 2.4C warming, according to new analysis. So what would happen to the world at 2C and 3C? At 2C, all tropical coral reefs would be destroyed and flooding would worsen. Animals and plant species would lose their habitats and many more people would face extreme heat. Warming of 3C upwards would see hundreds of millions of people displaced from their homes due to sea level rises.

234,COP26,Joseph Lee,COP26: PM calls on nations to pull out the stops as draft agreement published,2021-11-10,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is returning to the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow - urging nations to ""pull out all the stops"" to limit warming.
The first draft of an agreement setting out how countries will cut emissions to avoid temperature rises of above 1.5C has been published.
The agreement - or ""cover decision"" - sets out what negotiators hope will be the outcome of the COP26 talks.
It encourages richer countries to scale up support for poorer nations.
The seven-page draft agreement focuses on adaptation - helping countries deal with the effects of climate change - and finance, a controversial issue because poorer countries blame richer countries for not contributing enough.
The document says meeting the goal to limit global warming to 1.5C - which countries pledged to try to pursue under the Paris climate accord - needs meaningful and effective action in ""this critical decade"".
The agreement, which was published by the UK Cop26 presidency, will have to be negotiated and agreed by countries attending the talks.
Scientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5C - beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt - requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030 and to zero overall by mid-century.
The document may be just seven pages long but it attempts to steer COP26 towards a series of significant steps that will prevent global temperature rises going above 1.5C this century.
Perhaps the most important part of that is getting countries to improve their carbon cutting plans.
To that end this draft decision urges parties to ""revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally-determined contributions, as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022"".
It will be interesting to see how countries such as China, India, Brazil and Saudi Arabia respond to this request to put new plans on the table by the end of next year.
There is some comfort for developing countries to see that their financial needs are recognised as countries are asked to mobilise climate finance ""beyond $100bn a year"" and the draft welcomes steps to put in place a much larger, though as yet unspecified, figure for support from 2025.
Loss and damage, an issue of key importance to the developing world, is included in the draft with encouragement to richer countries to scale up their action and support including finance for poorer nations.
The document also calls on countries to accelerate the phase out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels - but has no firm dates or targets on this issue. Campaigners will welcome the inclusion and will hope it survives into the final text.
Despite the promises made at the summit so far, the planet is still heading for 2.4C of warming above pre-industrial levels, according to a report by Climate Action Tracker.
A global average temperature rise of just 2C could mean a billion people are affected by fatal heat and humidity, the Met Office has warned.
Ahead of his return to the summit, Mr Johnson said: ""Negotiating teams are doing the hard yards in these final days of COP26 to turn promises into action on climate change. There's still much to do.""
The prime minister said he would be meeting ministers and negotiators to hear about the progress made and where gaps must be bridged.
""This is bigger than any one country and it is time for nations to put aside differences and come together for our planet and our people,"" he said.
""We need to pull out all the stops if we're going to keep 1.5C within our grasp.""
A coalition of nations which are vulnerable to climate change, along with the US and European nations, is pressing for countries to submit action plans in the next year in line with limiting warming to 1.5C, and by 2023 to produce their long-term plans to meet the target.
The summit is still negotiating a deal that all 197 countries will agree on. But a series of side deals were announced last week:
With Wednesday named as transport day at COP26, the UK announced that new heavy goods vehicles sold from 2040 will need to have zero emissions.
Thirty countries have agreed to work together to increase the use of zero emissions vehicles, while plans for ""green shipping corridors"" to help a shift towards zero-emissions vessels are also due to be unveiled.
Another 14 states which are responsible for more than 40% of global aviation emissions have committed to a new decarbonisation target.
But the UK's Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said travel, including flying, should be ""guilt-free"" and said the government did not see aviation as ""the ultimate evil"".
He told the Daily Telegraph that changes to how we live our lives should not mean ""the inability to go and visit you friends and family and do business"".
Attendees at COP26, including the prime minister, have faced criticism for using planes for short journeys to and from the conference.

236,COP26,Steffan Messenger,Climate change: Corporate mass tree planting 'damaging' nature,2021-11-10,"Large firms buying up farms in rural Wales to plant trees have been accused of using the land to ""offset their guilt"" over emissions.
Thomas Crowther, an Earthshot Prize finalist, also warned mass planting of the same type of tree on swathes of land could be ""dangerous"" for nature.
Recently a number of west Wales' farms have been bought by investment companies for tree planting schemes.
The scientist has urged companies to be socially and ecologically responsible.
Greater effort to conserve a wide variety of ecosystems is needed to meet climate change goals, and people from the areas had to be involved, he said.
Moves by large-scale investment companies to buy up family farms - in an attempt to offset carbon emissions - have led to fears whole communities could be ""destroyed"".
Prof Crowther, who grew up in Prestatyn, Denbighshire, is a professor of ecosystem ecology at ETH Zurich University in Switzerland and also chairs an advisory board for the United Nations on ecosystem restoration.
He warned blanket planting of trees was ""hugely threatening"".
""This is not about offsetting your guilt, that would be an absolutely devastating step for climate change,"" he said.
Speaking at COP26 in Glasgow, Prof Crowther said the loss of biodiversity was arguably a bigger threat to the planet than climate change.
""If we save the climate but we lose nature that's still an unliveable planet,"" said the scientist, who studied at Cardiff University.
He said it had become increasingly clear that efforts to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees depended on doing much more to restore the natural world.
Prof Crowther's post-doctoral research made headlines when it estimated there were approximately 3.04 trillion trees on Earth - 46% fewer than at the onset of agriculture about 12,000 years ago.
It sparked the Trillion Tree campaign which is being ""very prominently discussed"" at COP26.
Although Prof Crowther emphasised it was important people ""understand that we're not just talking about planting trees"".
""In the vast majority of cases, what we're really going to be doing is protecting large areas of land, we need to protect a third of the land surface so that nature can recover and naturally grow,"" he added.

A recent report by environment regulators in Wales found that almost half of the country's protected sites for nature were left unmonitored due to lack of funds.
Where information was held, Natural Resources Wales said 60% of sites were in ""unfavourable condition"".
Prof Crowther said this ""absolutely"" needed to be sorted out and that technology and online platforms could help with monitoring.
His own - Restor - which aims to connect restoration projects from around the world to increase the impact of their efforts, was shortlisted in the nature conservation category for the Earthshot Prize.
People wanting to start their own projects can also use the site to find others with the expertise needed, the aim being to ""make an economically sustainable, global restoration movement"".
The Earthshot Prize was devised by Prince William to reward innovations that could help save the planet.
Prof Crowther said the experience had been ""an absolute whirlwind"".
""Prince William has been so supportive, he's actually working with us to support all of these efforts.
""It's not just that you're finalists and well done you, they're committed to helping us ensure that we succeed in the long term because that's what the world needs.""

It is three years since it edged dangerously towards what was described as ""Day Zero"" - the moment when some four million inhabitants would be left without water. 
Its existential crisis was triggered by a severe and unanticipated drought that turned all the local reservoirs into dustbowls.
Today, dozens of teams armed with chainsaws are seeking to protect those reservoirs in an unusual manner - by chopping down tens of thousands of trees on the mountains surrounding them. 
It is a furiously ambitious, and oddly counter-intuitive battle to limit the impact of climate change.
On a recent morning, high above a thick layer of mist, two workers abseiled down a steep ravine to remove several isolated pine trees in an area that was littered with stumps.
""The pines are not indigenous to this area. They use up so much water - much more water than indigenous plants. This is the green infrastructure that we need to fix,"" explained Nkosinathi Nama, who is co-ordinating the work for The Nature Conservancy on behalf of the Greater Cape Town Water Fund.
The non-indigenous pine trees, initially brought into the region for the timber industry, have spread fast across the mountains, crowding out the local, far more resilient, and less thirsty flora in Cape Town's catchment areas. 
The pines, and other alien species like the eucalyptus, are now responsible for consuming an estimated 55 billion litres of water per year - equivalent to two to three months of the city's annual consumption. 
""One of the lessons of Day Zero is that our water catchment areas need to be rehabilitated and restored so that they are resilient,"" he said. 
The initial five-year project is just one of many responses to Cape Town's 2018 water crisis, as scientists and administrators seek to learn from the experience.
As well as protecting and diversifying the city's water sources - including tapping into underground aquifers and installing desalination plants - experts have also been studying how humans responded to the threat of Day Zero in terms of water-usage.
""We underestimate the ability of citizens to adapt to a crisis,"" said Dr Kevin Winter, an environmental expert at the University of Cape Town.
He points out that the city's water consumption nearly halved in the space of just three weeks in early 2018, from roughly 780 megalitres per day to under 550, before sinking even lower. An extraordinary display of public unity.
""People got really scaredâ¦ And it had the desired effect,"" he said.
Siyabonga Myeza, a community activist working for the Environmental Monitoring Group in the Khayelitsha township outside Cape Town, agrees: ""Fear works.
""That thought of running out of water as a city was quite tragic and very scary and the city did quite well at preaching the message of saving water, and we halved our water use. 
""But in the long term we probably need a more holistic shift of mindset."" 
In the years since then, perhaps inevitably, water usage has increased in Cape Town.
But it remains far below the peak, set back in 2014, of 1.2 billion litres per day.
The experience of being forced to save water, or face fines or other penalties, has clearly left a lasting impression on many households.
Other lessons include a greater appreciation of the role of agriculture in water management - in South Africa, as in many parts of the world, approximately 70% of water reserves are used to irrigate farmland. 
Around Cape Town, farmers agreed to stop using municipal water completely for several months.
The Day Zero crisis also emphasised the increasingly unpredictable nature of weather patterns in an era of climate change. 
By the end of 2018, Cape Town had received more rain than average. Just not during the usual seasons.
But while there is growing confidence that the Western Cape province is now in a much stronger position to cope with future droughts, there is little evidence that other parts of South Africa have learnt the same lessons.
In the far poorer Eastern Cape province, where farmers are struggling to cope with their own devastating seven-year-long drought, the heavily populated Nelson Mandela Bay area is facing acute water shortages that are widely blamed on years of mismanagement and corruption, and a failure to maintain vital water infrastructure.
""Fortunately, the leadership of Cape Town rose to the occasion. They did everything andâ¦ carried the people with them and as a consequence it helped them to overcome the problem,"" said Mkhuseli Jack, a businessman and opposition politician in the city of Gqeberha.
""Here it's the other way round because this place is led by very mediocre leaders. People have reached a stage where they won't believe anything politicians are saying here.""
Gqerberha is now trying to focus minds by warning that its own Day Zero may arrive within months, while the taps have already run dry in some smaller towns in the province, and many neighbourhoods are dependent on irregular water truck deliveries made by a local charity.
""We've had no water for two days. I'm worried about the future because it's going to be worse and worse. Because [the government] doesn't look after us,"" said Elsie Hanse, 53, who lives in a shack in a township on the edge of Graaff-Reinet, a town in the Eastern Cape.
""They built us some toilets here, but we can't use them because there's no water.""

241,COP26,Debbie Jackson,The Barras banter on COP26 and climate change,2021-11-09,"It would be hard to find a place more ""Glasgow"" than The Barras.
The area, east of Glasgow city centre, houses the popular weekend market and the iconic music venue the Barrowland ballroom. 
It has survived war, fire and redevelopment. Time will tell if the area, and the city will survive the threat on everyone's minds - climate change.
It is less than three miles from the high-level talks of COP26, and the people in the cafes, stores and event spaces are all talking about it.
Bill's Tool Store is a landmark at The Barras. It has been in Alan's family for three generations and celebrates its 75th anniversary next year.
He wants to see promises kept from COP26.
He said: ""I think what they are trying to do is great... if they carry it through. If this is the 26th one, what has happened at the other 25 that hasn't worked?
""I think the penny's dropped for us at home, looking at all the plastics we use has certainly made my family realise we have to do more.""
He says he would like to cut the carbon footprint of the business, but it is tricky.
""The problem we have is that more than 90% of what people buy from us is made in China or India and until these countries do something, we are stuck,"" he said. 
""We don't manufacture enough in this country now so we have no control over it. We try to buy local and British whenever we can but there are very few suppliers.""
Parked up in his tour bus outside the Barrowland ballroom music venue is driver Keith Pittaway.
He knew COP26 was going on in Glasgow when he drove the band Easy Life into town for their gig.   
Keith says a lot of the acts he transports are worried about the climate and the consequences for touring.
But he can't see a solution yet.  
""Don't forget you are sitting on a 26-ton bus that's using a gallon per ten miles, but you don't mind that because you've got to get from A to B. 
He adds: ""These things are never going to run at 700km a day on electric. It is just not going to happen.""
Saint Luke's is a newer music venue and bar around the corner from the Barrowland. It has quickly cemented itself in the hearts of Glaswegian music lovers. It had hoped to enjoy a COP26 boost but people have been avoiding the city.
Owner Michael thinks it has been a missed opportunity.
""Messaging has told people to stay away from the city but I think that's a mistake. I think they should have been embracing the event and the visitors. People make Glasgow but nobody is in Glasgow to make it.""
He thinks a lot of Glaswegians have felt a bit detached from what is going on at the COP26 conference.
""We had a fringe festival called Beyond The Green over the weekend to do with sustainability and building products. But we put everything on ourselves. I think they have missed a trick in not getting everybody else in the city involved.""
Reeta Fashions is another Barras institution, outfitting the brides of Glasgow for the past 70 years. 
Owner Sheran is proud her city has been hosting COP26 and took her 10-year-old daughter to the climate rally last weekend. 
""She knows all about climate change, they have been learning about it at school and I think it's important for her to understand. I think it's really positive for the city.
""Although the big motorcades were a bit uncomfortable to see, because that doesn't really represent climate change.""
Sheran is aware of the damage the fashion industry does to the environment and is happy to see her industry changing.
""A lot of our suppliers are changing the way the fabrics are being made, to make them more environmentally friendly, which is great to see.""
Denise dishes out ""rolls and sausage and banter"" in the east end of the city. The only thing she has noticed about COP26 being in town is that the city and even the Barras has been quiet, even at the weekend when it's usually the busiest time.
""For my kids and their kids I worry about climate change,"" she says. ""It upsets me to see billionaires going into space when there's so much more that can be done to make things better on this planet.
""I know this is down to all of us so I am a big recycler. I buy all the different recycling bags from the council to make sure we recycle properly.""
Unbeknown to the locals, some COP26 activity is merely metres away from them. Around the corner from Dengy's, in the Pipe Factory venue,  a session is exploring how to get more women into the COP negotiations.
Georgia Elliot-Smith is a former UNESCO special junior envoy for youth and the environment. She is part of a a group called She Changes Climate that is trying to see at least 50% representation of women at the top table of climate negotiations - 90% at the moment are male.
She said: ""We've had 25 previous COPs and yet carbon emissions are still increasing - we feel we need a different mentality, a different perspective, some diversity to come up with different solutions because what we have been doing isn't working.
""We wanted to be real and part of the community and to bring people into a different Glasgow - to bring women from all over the world together to see what we can do.""

242,Climate change,BBC News,Swimmers in Cleethorpes want action over sewage in sea and rivers,2021-11-09,"Swimmers and paddleboarders say they have seen a growing amount of ""sewage, wipes and sanitary products"" in the rivers and sea around Lincolnshire.
One group in Cleethorpes said the issue is becoming ""more prevalent"" and called for tighter controls on pollution.
Regional water supplier Anglian Water said it was not aware of any recent sewage discharges in the area.
MPs have agreed water companies should be ""forced"" to be more proactive in improving water quality.
More stories from Yorkshire and Lincolnshire
Paddleboarders around Cleethorpes said there had been 21 pollution alerts in the area and 16 more along the coast at Humberston, an increase on last year.
Instructor Caroline Carr said: ""We were doing an evening paddleboard session in the sea at Brighton Slipway [in Cleethorpes], and sewage and wipes and sanitary products were visible.""
Andrew Johnson, who swims or paddleboards in the River Humber every week, said he believes water companies should do more to protect the environment.
Anglian Water said it was not aware of any sewage discharge in the area but said it had seen ""storm related activity"" following heavy rainfall in the area.
A spokesperson said ""these discharges would have been predominantly rain water"" and any activity was ""in line with out permits"".
The Environment Agency allows water utilities to release sewage into rivers and streams after extreme weather events, such as prolonged heavy rain.
This protects properties from flooding and prevents sewage from backing up into streets and homes.
On Monday MPs voted to back tougher regulation, though some say the proposals do not go far enough.
Cleethorpes MP Martin Vickers said while government bodies can enforce existing legislation, it ""clearly needs stepping up"", adding that water companies and regulators must be ""forced"" to be more proactive in order to make a difference to water quality.
Anglia Water added that it did not believe the existing permits were ""fit for purpose"" and called for increased funding to tackle the problem of overloaded sewers and other environmental improvements.
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the amount of sewage pumped into the rivers and sea is ""unacceptable"", adding: ""We are the first government to take action on this, but it won't be solved overnight and will need significant investment.""

243,Climate change,Victoria Gill,Ocean's climate change 'buffer' role under threat,2021-11-09,"Researchers studying the ocean at depths of up to 6km have found that climate change has a ""worrying"" effect on its ability to lock away carbon. 
The latest discovery comes from the International ""i-Atlantic"" project. 
It has revealed that - if global temperatures increase to levels predicted - the ocean will not be able to provide what is currently Earth's largest long-term carbon store.    
One third of the carbon dioxide in our atmosphere dissolves in the ocean.Â 
It therefore acts as an important buffer against rising temperatures.
Carbon is one of the chemical elements in the key planet-warming gas carbon dioxide (CO2). When that gas dissolves in the ocean, it is taken up by marine plants and animals becomes part of an ocean cycle that results in some of it being locked into the deep ocean mud for centuries.
Billions of tonnes of carbon is buried in the deep ocean's muddy floor. But this latest research shows that this cycle is disrupted by rising ocean temperatures. 
The study revealed a ""cycle of warming""; ocean temperature rise causes more of this buried carbon to be released as CO2, where it can contribute to yet more global warming.
In experiments carried out from the Spanish research vessel Sarmiento de Gamboa, scientists used tethered, robotic sample collectors to bring tubes of seafloor mud into their ocean laboratories. 
They then incubated those samples at deep ocean temperatures that are currently predicted for the end of this century. 
""This deep 'abyssal' ocean covers 60% of our planet and we're finding that, under higher temperatures, we can store less carbon in these places,"" said Prof Murray Roberts from the University of Edinburgh. 
""The ecosystems are turning the carbon over faster. They're running at a higher temperature more quickly, and they're going to release more carbon in the future.""
Prof Roberts said these experiments, which were led by Prof Andrew Sweetman's team at Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt University, showed that human activity had changed the ""very nature"" of the vast ocean. 
""As well as our carbon emissions, the ocean has absorbed over 90% of global heating,"" he explained. ""And if we don't understand [the impact of this] well enough, we can't make the most accurate models in the future.""
The need to understand more about the ocean's response to climate change, he added, was being brought into sharp focus by the negotiations at the COP26 climate summit - about how global leaders tackle the crisis. 
The same research project, funded by the European Commission, recently discovered  a dozen new ocean species in the Atlantic.  
Professor Daniela Schmidt, from the University of Bristol, who was not involved in this research, and who studies the causes and effects of climate change in the ocean, told BBC News: ""It's often said that we know more about the surface of the Moon than we do about the deep ocean, and it's true. 
""It's the largest habitat on Planet Earth.""
Because it's so vast, and so poorly understood, Prof Schmidt added, ""the worry is that we'll start destroying those ecosystems - and perturb all these vital processes - that we really don't understand"".

244,Climate change,BBC News,Llanbedr bypass: Axed Gwynedd road plan to cost Â£1.7m,2021-11-09,"A scrapped bypass road project cost taxpayers nearly Â£1.7m, new figures have revealed.
Last week, the Welsh government axed plans for the Â£14m bypass in Llanbedr, Gwynedd. 
Having already been granted planning permission last year, after 60 years of lobbying, the withdrawal sparked accusations of ""betrayal"".
The Welsh government pulled the plug following advice from a committee of transport and climate experts. 
Calls for the one-mile (1.5km) Llanbedr access road date back decades and it was hoped the road would cut traffic through the Snowdonia village by 90%, while improving access to the nearby aerospace centre, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
The decision is part of an ongoing review of Welsh government road projects and came after a panel concluded the road was likely to increase carbon emissions.
Responding to a written question by Member of the Senedd Natasha Asghar, deputy climate change minister Lee Waters confirmed the spend on the Gwynedd Council-led project was set to reach Â£1.67m.
He added: ""To date, Â£1.472m has been provided to Gwynedd Council for this scheme.
""We await a further claim from the council for costs incurred up to the decision not to proceed with the scheme, which we estimate to be around Â£200,000.""
Ms Asghar, a Conservative, said: ""Motorists were hoping this road would be the answer to their prayers and end traffic jams and long commutes in the area, but sadly Labour ministers have decided to let them carry on suffering.
""I find it astounding and appalling that this huge amount of taxpayer cash has been poured down the drain and there is absolutely nothing to show for it in north Wales.""
Mr Waters said he had asked officials to work with the council to commission Transport for Wales to develop an alternative package for consideration.
Gwynedd Council has been asked to comment.

245,COP26,BBC News,My Day at COP26: 'It's like a never-ending airport terminal',2021-11-09,"Science journalist, Helen Briggs, is at COP26 to report for the BBC. In the latest in a series of first-person accounts, she describes what life is like behind the scenes at the Glasgow summit.
Week two, and there's a familiar rhythm to the day. Wake, check the news, do a Covid test, check the news again. Then a walk beside the majestic River Clyde as joggers and cyclists dodge the stream of suited-and-booted delegates making their way to COP. 
Police patrol outside the iron gates but, once I'm through security, I'm in the ""Blue Zone"" where the key negotiations between world leaders are taking place. This is United Nations - not Scottish - territory for this fortnight only. 
Imagine a never-ending airport terminal with blue-carpeted corridors, lines of comfy chairs and restaurants. Countless languages fill the air, and officials in sleek suits and bright saris, men in feathered headdresses, and women with flowers in their hair dash back and forth, while teams huddle in negotiations behind the closed doors. 
Each day at COP there's a particular theme - today is Gender Day. COP President Alok Sharma has announced Â£165m of UK funding to tackle the inequalities that make women and girls more vulnerable to climate change, and there's a buzz around the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, being here to talk about the hardship faced by women and indigenous communities living on the frontlines of this crisis. 
I spend much of my day in the Press Centre where hundreds of journalists sit at socially-distanced desks, existing on a diet of carbon-counted sarnies and Irn-Bru. I'll be checking out stories, conducting interviews and filing copy. The air is charged with adrenaline, but through the windows there's a calming glimpse of the river beyond. Now and again, there's the sound of a helicopter hovering overhead. Information flows in and out at a mind-boggling speed, with journalists constantly coming and going to events and briefings. 
It's exhilarating and sometimes exhausting. But the finishing line is in sight. By the weekend negotiators from some 200 countries are aiming to reach an agreement on how to make sure all nations are sticking to their climate promises.
My Day at COP26:
The historic Paris Agreement, signed in 2016 - when world leaders agreed to keep a lid on rising temperatures - is at the front of everyone's minds. But some think there's unlikely to be such a significant breakthrough here. 
As one minister told me, COP26 is about putting flesh on the bones of the Paris Accords. But who will put their hands in their pockets to help the poorest countries deal with the ravages of climate change? And how will the world police the promises countries have made to stop clearing forests or burning coal? There are so many questions still to be answered.
Long after the sun has sunk over the Clyde, I head back to my hotel for a debrief with colleagues. We discuss what's on the agenda for tomorrow. But while my job is over for the day, I'm mindful the official negotiations will likely continue well into the night. And who knows what Thursday might bring?
As told to Sarah McDermott
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

246,Climate change,Michael Race,How much nuclear power does the UK use and is it safe?,2021-11-09,"Rolls-Royce is receiving more than Â£400m from the government and private investors to develop small nuclear reactors.
How does nuclear power fit in with the UK's plans to meet climate change targets?
Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) work in the same way as conventional nuclear reactors, but on a smaller scale.
Rolls-Royce says one SMR would take up the space of roughly two football pitches, about a tenth of the size of a conventional nuclear plant and would power approximately one million homes.
The company hasn't announced where SMRs would be built if approved, however, production is expected to be focused in the north of the UK, where there is existing nuclear expertise.
About 16% of Britain's electricity is provided by nuclear power from 13 reactors, according to the UK government.
But it wants around a quarter of Britain's energy to come from nuclear by 2025. 
The government's plan to reach ""net-zero"" emissions by 2050 says nuclear power provides a ""reliable source of low-carbon electricity"". 
Aside from SMRs, the government has backed the construction of Hinkley C in Somerset. It will be the largest nuclear station in Britain, delivering 7% of the UK's electricity.
There are also proposals for a nuclear plant on the coastline of Suffolk, known as Sizewell C. These have not yet been approved, and local objections remain.
In mid-2021, 415 nuclear reactors were operating in 33 countries, according to the World Nuclear Industry Status report. This doesn't include military reactors, such as those on nuclear submarines. 
Together, the ""big five"" - the US, China, France, Russia, and South Korea - generated 72% of all nuclear electricity in the world in 2020. 
The industry report says nuclear's share of the global energy market is steadily declining. 
But two countries, Belarus and the United Arab Emirates, started their first reactors last year.
The International Atomic Energy Agency, part of the United Nations, says nuclear power plants are among ""the safest and most secure facilities in the world"".
They are subject to stringent international safety standards. 
But there have been some high-profile accidents, where large amounts of radioactive material were released into the environment.
The worst nuclear accident in history resulted from an explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986. A tsunami caused by an enormous earthquake flooded the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan in 2011. 
Even under normal conditions, generating nuclear power produces radioactive waste which is hazardous, and needs to be safely managed and stored for hundreds of years. 
But a House of Lords paper from October says the issue of nuclear waste remains ""unresolved in the UK"".
It's currently stored in temporary facilities which are not designed for the permanent storage of so-called ""high-level"" radioactive waste.
The paper says the government's preferred solution is ""geological disposal"", which involves placing waste deep in a rock formation that would prevent radioactivity from escaping. 
However, no community has agreed to host such a facility.
The main nuclear fuels are uranium and plutonium. In a nuclear power station, the fuel undergoes a controlled ""chain reaction"" to produce heat which then drives turbines and generates electricity.
Unlike fossil fuels, nuclear power stations don't produce greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide or methane. Just 1kg of nuclear fuel produces millions of times more energy than 1kg of coal.
However, like fossil fuels, nuclear fuels are non-renewable energy resources. 
Building new nuclear plants of any size also creates emissions - for example through manufacturing the large amount of steel and other materials needed. 
The long-term environmental consequences of dealing with nuclear waste are also not clear. 
Critics say government investments should focus on renewable power, such as wind turbines and solar panels, instead of new nuclear capacity.
Nuclear power plants are extremely expensive to build, which is part of the reason the government is backing Rolls-Royce's cheaper design.
Each SMR is estimated to cost about Â£2bn, compared to a large-scale plant like Hinkley Point C, which could cost Â£23bn, although of course smaller reactors would also generate significantly less power. 
The government also hopes a new financial funding model could cut the cost of new nuclear projects.

247,COP26,Georgina Rannard,COP26: World headed for 2.4C warming despite climate summit - report,2021-11-09,"Despite pledges made at the climate summit COP26, the world is still nowhere near its goals on limiting global temperature rise, a new analysis shows.
It calculates that the world is heading for 2.4C of warming, far more than the 1.5C limit nations committed to.
COP26 ""has a massive credibility, action and commitment gap"", according to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT).
The Glasgow summit is seen as crucial for curbing climate change.
But the prediction contrasts with optimism at the UN meeting last week, following a series of big announcements that included a vow to stop deforestation.
COP26 is expected to finish this week.
The projection comes as the UK's Met Office warns that a billion people could be affected by fatal heat and humidity if the global average temperature rises by 2C above pre-industrial levels.
The report by Climate Action Tracker looks at promises made by governments before and during COP26. 
It concludes that, in 2030, the greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet will still be twice as high as necessary for keeping temperature rise below 1.5C degree.
Scientists say that limiting warming to 1.5C will prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change from happening.
The COP summit held in Paris in 2015 laid out a plan for avoiding dangerous climate change which included ""pursuing efforts"" to keep warming under 1.5C.
But when governments' actual policies - rather than pledges - are analysed, the world's projected warming is 2.7C by 2100, suggests Climate Action Tracker. The Tracker is backed by a number of organisations including the prestigious Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.

""This new calculation is like a telescope trained on an asteroid heading for Earth. It's a devastating report that in any sane world would cause governments in Glasgow to immediately set aside their differences and work with uncompromising vigour for a deal to save our common future,"" said Greenpeace International's executive director Jennifer Morgan.
However, the world's outlook has improved since the Paris climate summit in 2015 when Climate Action Tracker estimated the policies put the planet on track to warm by 3.6C.
Climate Action Tracker blames ""stalled momentum"" from governments for limited progress towards cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.
It says new promises by the US and China to reach net zero have slightly improved its forecasting on temperature rises. But it concludes that the quality of most government's plans to limit climate change is very low.
Reaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, then balancing out any remaining releases by, for example, planting trees - which remove CO2 from the atmosphere.
More than 140 governments have promised to reach net zero, covering 90% of global emissions.
But Climate Action Tracker says only a handful have plans in place to reach the goal. It analysed the policies of 40 countries and concluded that only a small number are rated ""acceptable"", covering a fraction of the world's emissions.
""If they have no plans as to how to get there, and their 2030 targets are as low as so many of them are, then frankly, these net zero targets are just lip service to real climate action,"" said Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, one of the groups behind the Tracker.
The main driver of the gap between promises and projections is continued coal and gas production, the organisation concludes.
With one sharp jab, this Climate Action Tracker report has punctured the balloon of optimism that's been swelling since the start of this conference. 
For days now, a number of observers, including the formerly conservative International Energy Agency, have been pushing a narrative that the new net zero goals from countries like India plus the long list of announcements made here in Glasgow had pushed the prospective temperature rise this century down to 1.8C.
That seemed like huge progress from the 2.7C that the UN Environment Programme had announced at the start of the conference. 
So how has the confusion come about?
The problem comes from the inclusion of long-term pledges to reach net zero emissions by 2050. 
More than 140 countries, covering 90% of global emissions have announced a mid-century-ish carbon neutrality target - China's is 2060, India's 2070.
According to the CAT, these goals are giving ""false hope"". 
Based on what countries have put on the table for 2030, the world is set to warm by 2.4C by 2100. That picture gets a bit better if you include the US's and China's long-term targets, which reduces the temperature to 2.1C.
If every country implemented their long-term net zeroes, then 1.8C could indeed be possible.
But the reality is that, without a serious plan for 2030, most of these longer-term goals will not be realised.
That's why the real focus for the negotiators here must be on the actions that countries take over the next nine years. 
Any deal agreed here will need to have a strong and credible pathway for the next decade. Otherwise Glasgow will be judged a failure. 
The summit is still negotiating a deal that all 197 countries will agree on. But a series of side deals were announced last week:

249,COP26,BBC News,COP26: Focus on gender as giant puppet takes centre stage,2021-11-09,"Here are five things you need to know about the COP26 climate change conference on Tuesday.
The inequalities that make women and girls more vulnerable to the effects of climate change are high on the agenda today. They form a large majority of the world's poor, often depending on small-scale farming for their livelihoods. The UK government is set to announce Â£165m to tackle climate change while addressing and empowering women to take climate action. And we can expect an appearance from Little Amal, the giant puppet of a 10-year-old Syrian refugee, meeting activists from the countries through which she has ""walked"" during a four-month, 8,000km (4,970-mile) journey from the Syrian border.
With negotiations in Glasgow at a critical phase, we asked more than a dozen climate scientists, negotiators and economists what they wanted to see agreed. Top of their list is a greater commitment to ""net zero"" emissions targets - in other words not increasing the amount of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, produced when we burn coal, oil or gas to generate power) in the atmosphere. As Prof Martin Siegert from Imperial College London puts it: ""The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050.""
Former US President Barack Obama earned a standing ovation for a speech declaring the world ""nowhere near where we need to be"" to avoid a climate catastrophe. He took aim at Donald Trump's ""active hostility toward climate science"" and chided Russia and China for their absence, calling on young people to ""stay angry"" while harnessing their frustration to press for political change. However, some activists pointed out the US had failed to honour key pledges made by Mr Obama's administration.

250,Climate change,BBC News,Cambo oil field project 'could jeopardise deep sea life',2021-11-09,"The proposed Cambo oil field project could jeopardise hundreds of species and contribute to the climate crisis, environmental groups have warned.
Environmentalists said pipelines would cut through the Faroe-Shetland Sponge Belt, a UK Marine Protected Area.
The warning comes amid controversy over whether the project, thought to contain hundreds of millions of barrels of oil, should get the go-ahead.
The UK government said an environmental impact assessment would be carried out.
The Cambo oil field is situated approximately 125km (75 miles) to the west of the Shetland Islands in water depths of between 1,050m (3,445ft) and 1,100m (3,609ft). 
Five different water masses meet in the area, bringing nutrients that help deep-living cold water species to thrive, including sponges known as ""cheese-bottoms"", worms, and long-lived molluscs called ocean quahog.
A review from the Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide warned that the project ""could jeopardise hundreds of species over several decades, as well as livelihoods"".
Sixteen marine protection and climate groups - including Greenpeace UK, WWF UK, the Marine Conservation Society and Friends of the Earth Scotland - have written to the offshore oil and gas environmental regulator, Opred, asking it to include marine impacts when assessing the Cambo drilling application.
They raised concerns about the likely impacts the pipelines would have on the seabed, on hundreds of marine species and on the local fishing industry, and underline the devastation that an oil spill in the area would cause.
Calum Duncan, of the Marine Conservation Society, said the ""precious sponge belt"" needed to be protected.
""Construction, movement and potential leaking from this pipeline could have devastating consequences for deep-sea sponge and protected features already under pressure from damaging activities such as deep-sea trawling"", he said.
Tessa Khan, of Uplift, said: ""This new oil field will contribute to the climate crisis while potentially damaging a sensitive underwater world. Everyone loses except the oil companies.""
Environmental campaigners have been calling on the UK government to stop Siccar Point Energy's Cambo proposal, in which oil and gas giant Shell has a stake.
A UK government spokesman said the Cambo oil field was originally licensed in 2001. He added: ""Development proposals for oil fields under existing licences are a matter for the regulators: the Oil and Gas Authority and Opred, following their standard regulatory processes.
""As part of regulatory process, Opred complete an environmental impact assessment and a public consultation on any proposal, including ensuring the impact on the marine environment is taken into account.""
The UK government's Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, recently said that the new field should get the go-ahead, arguing that it would be ""foolish to think that we can just run away from oil and gas"". 
Siccar Point Energy said it was committed to ""producing oil and gas responsibly"" during a transition away from fossil fuels. 
A spokesman added: ""The export pipeline from Cambo is for gas. All our environmental work is underpinned by extensive special scientific analysis and research, predominantly using external specialists.""
Shell declined to comment.

252,COP26,Joe Whitwell,Climate change: What do scientists want from COP26 this week?,2021-11-09,"As the COP26 climate summit enters its second week, negotiations in Glasgow have hit a critical phase. 
The conference is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. So we asked more than a dozen climate scientists, negotiators and economists from around the world what they wanted to see agreed this week.
The scientists all wanted to see more countries commit to net zero by 2050 at the latest. Yet many said changes in the next decade would be the most impactful.
Governments must agree to ""cut emissions by half in the next 10 years"", says Prof Mark Maslin, who researches the impact of humans on the environment at University College London.
The Paris climate agreement in 2015 committed countries to reach net zero between 2050 and 2100. But reaching net zero is not easy and means big changes to transport, manufacturing, food supplies, construction and almost every aspect of life. 
And many of the scientists think 2050 might be too late, particularly if countries don't cut emissions drastically before then. 
""The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050,"" says Prof Martin Siegert, who researches changes in glaciers at Imperial College London. 
More than 100 countries have made the 2050 commitment, yet dozens have not. Others big emitters, such as China and Saudi Arabia, have made a net zero commitment - but by 2060, not 2050. One of the world's largest emitters, India, says it will get to net zero by 2070 - 20 years later.
The scientists said countries must sign up to go quicker. ""We've got to get international consensus at least in principle around the notion of net zero by 2050,"" says Prof Siegert. ""If that can be done at least in principle at Glasgow, it will be a major step forward."" 
The scientists we spoke to said investment in fossil fuels also had to be stopped, with money instead going into renewables like solar and wind. 
Last week at COP, there were announcements on cuts to coal and methane, but many scientists say they don't go far enough. 
""There needs to be a blanket stop on any foreign investment that builds and supports coal power plants or any other fossil technology"" says Prof Malte Meinhausen, of the University of Melbourne.
And Dr Natalie Jones, a specialist in existential risk at the University of Cambridge, says countries need to publish robust plans and policies on how they will achieve their targets.
Having plans on paper, or in law, makes it easier to get countries to stick to their word, she says. ""It provides a kind of hook that you can use to hold countries accountable because you can say, 'well, you've promised this. This is your policy statement'."" 
""The UK, for example, has this relatively ambitious emissions reduction targets but it's concurrently trying to open a new oil field at the moment,"" she added. ""The science tells us these things are fundamentally incompatible.""  
One proposal from the scientists was for every country to have a limit on how much it can emit. 
However, what the limits for countries might be, and how any scheme might work in practice, is likely to lead to difficult negotiations. Previous attempts to reach an agreement have failed. 
An alternate solution, suggested by some we spoke to, was a global carbon tax system where consumers and companies, rather than governments, pay a tax on emissions. 
By making business as usual more expensive, they argue, companies will be more likely to invest in cleaner technologies, which is essential to lowering emissions around the world. 
""A carbon tax needs to happen,"" says Danae Kyriakopoulou a senior policy fellow at the London School of Economics. ""We have to create incentives and create change in behaviour.""
There is support for the idea. The head of the World Trade Organization recently called for a coordinated approach to taxes on emissions. However, higher costs could be passed on to consumers who use fossil fuels to drive their cars or heat their homes. 
Ms Kyriakopoulou thinks this could be managed by taking the money raised by a tax and redirecting it to reduce costs. A country could subsidise home insulation to keep homes warmer and reduce the cost of bills, for example. 
Many people in developing countries, are suffering, says Dr Aditya Bahadur, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development. 
""They need resources to adapt to these changes. They need knowledge and information. They need new kinds of technologies. They need protective infrastructure.""
The developed world had pledged to provide $100bn a year to poorer countries by 2020, but this has slipped to 2023. 
The US is already pledging more money, but the scientists we spoke to said reaching the commitment as soon as possible was important.
Dr Bahadur says a focus on adapting to climate change would allow countries to share technologies and advice on how to cope with extreme weather. 
For example, a country that experiences droughts or floods frequently could give advice to others that have just started experiencing extreme weather events. 
""I have a colleague in Bangladesh who says Bangladesh has a lot teach to Germany about how to deal with floods.""
There is optimism for collaboration and knowledge-sharing among those we spoke to. The Covid-19 pandemic was given as an example for how countries can find ways to work together. 
""I am optimistic that a lot of good things will come out of COP26,"" says Dr Nana Ama Browne Klutse, a scientist at the university of Ghana, in Accra. She contributed to a major UN report on climate change, published this year.   
""Everyone wanted to fight this pandemic. The whole world kind of became one."" She added: ""This is how I want to see the fight against climate change. The world must come together to have this fight, with a common goal.""

254,COP26,BBC News,COP26: Obama tells young people to stay angry on climate fight,2021-11-08,"Barack Obama has called on young people to ""stay angry"" in the fight against climate change at the COP26 summit.
The former US president urged them to apply political pressure to make a change, but warned they would need to accept compromises along the way.
Mr Obama said the world is ""nowhere near where we need to be"" to avoid a future climate catastrophe.
He criticised Donald Trump's ""active hostility toward climate science"", but said the US is ready to lead again.
Mr Obama also scolded China and Russia's leaders for not physically attending the COP26 summit.
Speaking in Glasgow, Mr Obama received rapturous applause when he took to the stage and a standing ovation at the end of his speech - but there was pushback from activists.
He called out nations for failing to meet the pledges they made in the 2015 Paris Agreement, when he was in the White House. 
However, activists were quick to point out those broken by his own administration, including the failure of a key promise by developed countries to deliver $100bn (Â£73bn) a year in climate finance to poorer nations.
Perhaps a little unsure of his location in Scotland, Obama referred to being in the ""Emerald Isles"", seemingly a mistaken reference to Ireland, which is known poetically as the Emerald Isle. He also quoted Shakespeare, who was English.
He admitted there is still a lot of hard and messy work to do to reduce the effects of climate change, but said some promising progress had been made in the six years since the signing of the Paris Agreement, which he helped spearhead.
Mr Obama dedicated much of his speech to young activists, who he said were ""right to be frustrated"".
Addressing young people directly, he said they ""can't ignore politics"" and that while protesting and hashtags raise awareness, they should get involved in politics at some level.
""You don't have to be happy about it, but you can't ignore it. You can't be too pure for [politics].""
Referencing his own daughters' shopping habits, he also called on young people to support businesses that were committed to sustainability, and boycott those that were not.
Obama's catchphrase of the night was telling young activists to ""stay angry"".
""To all the young people out there - I want you to stay angry. I want you to stay frustrated,"" he said.
""But channel that anger. Harness that frustration. Keep pushing harder and harder for more and more. Because that's what's required to meet that challenge. Gird yourself for a marathon, not a sprint.""

He honoured the dedication of activists such as Greta Thunberg who are ""forming movements across borders"", and urged young people to at least get out and vote for politicians who will stand against climate change.
""Vote like your life depends on it, because it does"", he said.
The former president insisted that despite political divisions in the US and the country's absence from global climate efforts for four years during the Trump administration, America was now back on track and committed to change.
Mr Obama made a number of comments about his predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, who once called climate change ""an expensive hoax"" and controversially pulled out of the Paris climate accord when he took office. The US rejoined it under Joe Biden.
Mr Obama reserved some of his strongest criticism for the Republican Party. He accused its members of stalling progress by ""sitting on the sidelines"" and making climate change a partisan issue with ""four years of active hostility toward climate science"".
He said Republicans who take climate change seriously are ""a rare breed right now."" This is the first year a delegation of Republicans has attended a UN climate summit.
Mr Obama also blamed the pandemic, rise of US nationalism and a lack of cooperation from the Trump administration for a breakdown in international relations that has affected the climate crisis.
Taking a swipe at Russia and China, Mr Obama also said it was ""particularly discouraging"" that the leaders of ""two of the world's largest emitters"" had not attended the climate summit in person.
While more than 120 leaders turned up at the conference, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, who have both avoided international travel since the start of the pandemic, opted to take part remotely instead.
Mr Obama said they were showing a ""dangerous lack of urgency"".
The 44th US president closed by telling the crowd that fighting climate change will be hard and messy with ""every victory incomplete"".
""The thing we have going for us is that humanity has done hard things before,"" he said, adding: ""I believe we can do hard things again.""
Barack Obama's speech to COP26 was a study in hope and doubt. 
He touted the work his administration and that of Joe Biden have accomplished in addressing climate change, while acknowledging he wasn't ""real happy"" about what the Trump administration had done in the intervening four years. 
He lamented the fierce opposition Republicans have mounted toward addressing climate change in the US and the rise of tribalism and nationalism around the world, but pointed to efforts by states, local governments and private citizens to fill the policy void. 
He heralded the international co-operation evident during the Paris climate negotiations and in Glasgow over the past week, but said much more needs to be done. He even acknowledged that he doesn't have all the answers and at times gets discouraged, but he said the energy and efforts of young people give him faith in the future.
It was a delicate balance for a former president who made ""hope and change"" his trademark line. 
But the rhetoric was reflective of the tenuous nature of current US climate polices, which are dependent on Democratic majorities that could vanish in coming elections even though, Mr Obama said, there is still much work left to do.

257,COP26,BBC News,My day at COP26: 'Being the local host is a really important job',2021-11-08,"Kat Jones is creating a warm welcome in Glasgow for COP26 visitors - in her role as project manager for Stop Climate Chaos Scotland. In the latest personal story from the Glasgow summit, she explains how she is helping to make people at the UN climate conference feel at home.
Even without inflated prices, there are lots of people who need to come to COP who can't afford to stay in Â£100-a-night hotels - people coming from the countries most affected by climate change, young activists, and smaller NGOs (non-governmental organisations) which don't have much funding.
We've set up the Homestay Network so they aren't excluded. As well as offering space in private homes, hosts are helping people find their way around, recommending places to visit and serving them local food. It's not just about finding environmentally-friendly and affordable accommodation for delegates who are struggling - it's also about cultural exchange and friendship. Glasgow is such a welcoming city.
Often, at previous COPs, churches and village halls opened their doors and large groups could just take their sleeping bags along. But, because of Covid, it's much harder to do that. With the Homestay Network you've got one person staying with one family - it's a much safer way of providing accommodation.
We've had an unprecedented level of demand - almost 12,000 overnight stays have been booked. And not just from small youth organisations, but also from people we really didn't expect - from richer nations, climate scientists and things like that.
I had some people from Madagascar staying with me and they left this morning, so I'm going to Queen Street Station today to meet some new guests and take them back to my house. They're young people from Pacific islands who'd been offered Â£200-a-night accommodation - that was just too much.
My Day at COP26:
When I went to COP in Madrid two years ago, there was no single place to find information about what was going on - it was all by word of mouth and that made it really difficult to navigate. We've been working non-stop for weeks to upload details of events happening inside and outside COP - whether it's a few people around a dinner table or a massive launch party for a film by David Attenborough - on to the Climate Fringe website where people can find out everything that's happening. 
There are thousands of really amazing things going on and so much excitement around Glasgow right now. We're also hosting open-mic ceilidhs in the evenings where anyone can bring their songs and stories. It's been incredible - a wonderful mix of artists and musicians and poets. It feels like the absolute antidote to the plenaries (the sessions attended by all delegates), panel discussions and all the networking inside COP - which have none of the warmth or welcome or atmosphere.
There's just so much solidarity and love from people in Glasgow for the delegates coming to COP26 to sound the alarm for climate justice. It's been really amazing to be part of it.
As told to Sarah McDermott
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

More than a hundred people joined the march against the backdrop of the ongoing COP26 summit in Glasgow.
Pete Christian from the Isle of Man Friends of the Earth said they had a ""small voice but it ought to be heard"".
The protestors were among tens of thousands to take part in the global day of action.
Mr Christian said it was not a protest against the Manx government but aimed to create a ""louder voice to all governments"".
He said it was good for politicians to see the march representing ""a broader interest in common"" rather than ""parochial"" ones. 
Chairman of the climate change transformation board MHK Daphne Caine led a Manx delegation at the conference in Scotland last week. 
She said: ""I am hoping to deliver the change demanded by the new Chief Minister Alf Cannan, to enable the Isle of Man to meet its commitments under the Climate Change Bill and the Paris Agreement.
""Without the world coming together we won't stop global warming and the destruction of our planet... The time for action is now.""
Mr Christian said the island's emissions had risen dramatically since 1990 across electricity generation, home heating and transport.
He said: ""We're pumping more energy into the atmosphere and making the problem worse and worse by the day.
""We really need to focus very closely on 2030 and to get our emissions reduced by roughly half.""
COP26 has now entered its second week and so far more than 40 countries have promised to phase out coal by 2050.
The UK climate conference continues until 12 November.

260,COP26,BBC News,COP26: Fewer than 50 arrests during the summit to date,2021-11-08,"Fewer than 50 arrests have been made during the first week of COP26, police have confirmed.
Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie said the relationship between protesters and the police has been ""largely non-contentious"". 
A series of small protests took place in Glasgow last week before about 100,000 people joined a huge demonstration on Saturday. 
It was the largest protest in the city in recent memory. 
Police praised the majority of the ""good natured"" marchers who took part in the procession from Kelvingrove Park to Glasgow Green.
Officers made 22 arrests at the event - one after a socialist group were contained and the rest after protesters chained themselves on a bridge.
A small number of people were also arrested earlier in the week during an Extinction Rebellion demonstration where activists tried to force their way into the offices of the SSE energy company. 
Assistant Chief Constable Ritchie said: ""For such a highly significant event, to reach the end of the first week with fewer than 50 arrests being made is testament to the fact the relationship between protesters and the police has been largely non-contentious.
""This event has already provided us with some unique challenges, but our officers and staff have risen to face them, and the broadly good nature of the members of the public we are interacting with has made this a widely positive experience.
""I very much hope this atmosphere continues into the second week ahead of COP26 coming to its conclusion.""
Assistant Chief Constable Ritchie told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland a small group of socialist activists were contained during Saturday's three-mile march through Glasgow because they were slowing down other marchers and failing to follow police instructions. 
About 10,000 officers are being deployed in Glasgow each day during the UN climate summit. 
In one of the largest policing operations undertaken in the country, officers have been drafted in from across Scotland and from police services around the UK. 
More protests by campaigners are planned for the second week of the summit.
About 40 Extinction Rebellion protestors laid down outside the offices of an assets management company in the centre of Glasgow on Monday. 
Some of the protestors covered themselves in makeshift shrouds and have described their protest as a ""die in"". 
They are targeting the company Mercer because they say it invests in fossil fuel companies.  
Scientists Rebellion, the group which chained themselves to King George V Bridge in Glasgow on Saturday leading to 21 arrests, has also been protesting again. 
The group gathered at the same location for a ""teach-in"" protest.
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

261,COP26,BBC News,Calls for Guernsey to take immediate climate change action,2021-11-08,"Cutting down on food imports could help Guernsey tackle climate change a deputy has said. 
Deputy Jonathan LeTocq attended the COP26 conference in Glasgow and said he wanted the island to move away from a reliance on imports. 
In Guernsey about 200 people gathered over the weekend to promote action against climate change. 
Protesters said they wanted to ""show solidarity"" and promote the need to come together to save the planet. 
Speaking from COP26, Mr LeTocq said: ""We need more sustainable farming, more sustainable food production, there's a lot we can do there.
""If we ate more of our fish we catch in our own waters, which are excellent, then we'd be healthier and secondly we wouldn't need to import so much. 
""So it's simple things like that that we can do in Guernsey and that I think as a government we should try to encourage our communities to do.""
The states previously set a target of ""net zero"" greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. 
Protestors marched from Market Square to Candie Gardens on Sunday, calling for more immediate action on climate change. 
One woman, who did not give her name, told the BBC: ""We have the potential, like with Covid, to make huge changes.""

263,COP26,Navin Singh Khadka,COP26: Rich countries âpushing backâ on paying for climate loss,2021-11-08,"Vulnerable countries at COP26 say rich nations are pushing back against their attempts to secure compensation for the damage caused by climate change.
Poorer countries see it as critical that money for loss and damage be part of negotiations this week. 
Negotiators agreed in Paris in 2015 to address the issue, but there is no agreement on who should pay for it.
Rich nations are said to be resisting any commitments as they do not want to accept liability and risk being sued.
Developing countries argue that rich countries are responsible for most of today's climate change impacts because they started emitting carbon much earlier than the rest of the world.
""Loss and damage is still a taboo for developed countries,"" said Alpha Oumar Kaloga, one of the lead negotiators of the Africa Group, who also represents Guinea in the Least Developed Countries bloc (LDC). The majority of the 46 countries in the LDC bloc are in Africa.
""During negotiations, we have been repeatedly arguing that loss and damage needs to be mentioned in a separate column in the climate finance reporting papers of developed countries, because such losses and damages are happening all over the world,"" Mr Kaloga said.
The resistance from rich countries behind closed doors is particularly frustrating when they are at the same time ""talking about transparency in this whole process.""
A report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) this year showed that in 2019, about 25% of climate finance from developed countries went towards adaptation - preparing for extreme weather events, or building seawalls, for example - while the rest went to fund projects to reduce carbon emissions.
Poor countries say climate change is impacting on communities with such intensity that they can no longer adapt, but instead need financial support to rebuild, or to move away.
As holder of the COP presidency, the UK has been co-ordinating the talks. A spokesperson said the UK was ""listening to the views of all parties and the final text will be agreed by consensus"". 
Le-Anne Roper, lead negotiator on loss and damage for the Alliance of Small Island States, wants a new finance goal just for loss and damage. 
This would be separate from the $100bn (Â£74bn) already pledged - a target the world has already missed for 2020 which is now set for 2023.
""It is the only way we will be able to give our people a better chance at surviving, given the growing scale of the crisis and the need for significant action to address loss and damage,"" she told the BBC.
Harjeet Singh, senior adviser for Climate Action Network International, said climate change was destroying entire communities.
""This is about providing relief, rehabilitation and support to those who are simply displaced forever,"" he said.
There were no immediate comments from loss and damage negotiators from some developed countries contacted by the BBC.
There has been criticism from developing countries that adaptation has not received enough attention at COP26, and that the agenda has been dominated by carbon emissions reduction which has to do mainly with developed nations and fast-emerging economies like China and India.   
Several poor countries have also come under criticism for not making best use of the funds made available to them. Experts say issues like bad governance and corruption have been a major challenge in implementing adaptation projects.

264,Climate change,BBC News,"Woodland of 13,000 trees to be planted on Exmoor",2021-11-08,"A new woodland is being planted on Exmoor as part of a drive to increase tree cover and fight climate change.
The project which has started at Bye Wood involves increasing woodland cover by 13.5% to the recommended 17% by 2050 on Exmoor National Park.
The first 300 of 13,000 trees were planted at the weekend at a site near Winsford in Somerset by volunteers.
Patrick Watts-Mabbott from the national park authority said the project is ""all part of the climate emergency"". 
The trees will also help to keep the River Exe clean, he added.
Organisers hope the trees will help the moorland cope with a warmer climate and more unpredictable weather in the future. 
It is estimated that five million tonnes of carbon are stored in trees on Exmoor which helps to capture about 50,000 tonnes of carbon every year. 
The new woodland will span 12 hectares and help lock away about 2,600 tonnes of carbon during the first 100 years. 
Trees not traditionally associated with Exmoor that do better in hotter and drier climates are being planted.
A mixture of oak, hawthorn and Scots pine will also benefit the nearby river, it is claimed.
Jack Hunt, a woodlands assistant said they wanted Bye Wood to have ""multiple objectives"" including carbon storage, habitat creation, adding to the local sustainable economy and increasing connectivity for wildlife. 
""In 80 years when our trees reach maturity the climate will be different,"" said Mr Hunt, who was part of the design process for the woodland. 
Graeme McVittie, senior woodlands officer for the national park authority, said: ""As the soil biology develops, it will become more efficient at sequestering and storing carbon.""

265,COP26,Adam Durbin & George Bowden,COP26: UK pledges Â£290m to help poorer countries cope with climate change,2021-11-08,"The UK is pledging Â£290m to help poorer countries cope with the impact of climate change, as the COP26 climate change summit enters its second week.
Government ministers from around the world are in Glasgow for more talks.
They will discuss how to support poorer countries and if reparations for damage from natural disasters should be paid.
Poorer nations have called for $100bn of financial help, arguing they are already suffering and will be worst affected by climate change.
Developing countries have historically contributed a very small proportion of the damaging emissions driving climate change - while currently the wealthiest 1% of the global population account for more than double the combined emissions of the poorest 50%.
The majority of the money from the UK will go to help Asian and Pacific nations plan and invest in climate action, improve conservation and promote low-carbon development, the government said. 
The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office described the Â£290m as ""new funding"" from the foreign aid budget. The government said last month that cuts to the UK's foreign aid spending, to 0.5% of national income, will stay in place until at least 2024-25. 
Senior government climate change advisers previously warned the cuts showed the UK was ""neither committed to nor serious about"" helping countries vulnerable to climate change ahead of COP26.
The UN summit will continue until Sunday, with much of the focus of the talks over how to limit global warming to the target of 1.5C.
Monday will see negotiators discuss how best to mitigate the impact of a warming planet, particularly for poorer countries.
Developing countries are asking for $100bn (around Â£73bn at current exchange rates) annually to help reduce emissions and adapt to climate change and reaching net-zero targets on emissions well before 2050.
A pledge for $100bn from wealthier nations was made as long ago as 2009, but the plans to have it in place by 2020 have not been realised and current targets aim to reach it by 2023 - an offer which has been described as ""extremely disappointing"".
International trade minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the world ""must act now"" to prevent more people being pushed into poverty by climate change.
The government said its Â£290m in new funding to tackle the impact of climate change will be split between:
But there is also the question of whether rich nations should pay reparations to vulnerable countries for damage already caused by climate change.
Wealthy nations have never acknowledged legal liability for the impact of their emissions - because the bill could run into trillions.
So far, Scotland is the only country promising to donate to a compensation fund for countries whose economies have been damaged by climate change with a Â£1m pledge.
Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, said Scotland's pledge is the first time any developed nation has tacitly admitted responsibility for contributing to global warming - and he believed it will not be the last.
The Glasgow COP isn't really one conference - in effect it's two processes in parallel.
One is a series of daily events organised by the British presidency of the COP. This innovation has already conjured welcome initiatives on forests, finance, methane and technology. This week it'll unveil pledges on transport, cities and science. They'll be significant if they're carried through.
Meanwhile in parallel the tangled talks of the formal UN process labour on.
There are disagreements over the rules governing climate deals, whether rich countries will offer more cash to poorer countries already suffering from dangerous heating - and whether given the urgency of climate disruption, nations should raise their carbon-cutting ambitions in two years instead of five.
There's also a question of reparations for nations harmed by emissions they didn't cause. So far the only contribution to the fund is Â£1m from Scotland.
It'll be a tough week.
Charity Christian Aid said some of the world's poorest countries could suffer an average 64% hit to their economy by the end of the century under current climate policies.
Mohamed Adow, director of Kenyan climate and energy think tank Power Shift Africa, described the ""scale of the economic disaster"" as ""deeply unjust"".
""The fact rich countries have consistently blocked efforts to set up a loss and damage fund to deal with this injustice is shameful"", he added.
The first week of the climate talks have led to a variety of pledges, including a major deal to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, and to cut methane emissions.
President of COP26, Alok Sharma, said the pledges made ""must be delivered on and accounted for"" by all nations. 
Former US President Barack Obama is expected to speak in Glasgow later about the progress made in the five years since the Paris Agreement took effect.

The COP26 climate conference is entering its second and final week. While there are representatives from different countries in Glasgow, there also delegates associated with the fossil fuel industry - emissions from which are causing global warming. There are more of those delegates - 503 - said to lobby for oil and gas industries than from any single country, according to Global Witness analysis shared with the BBC. It says the ""fossil fuel industry has spent decades denying and delaying real action on the climate crisis"" and campaigners believe they should be banned. The International Emissions Trading Association argues there is a process of transition under way in line with its goal to find the most efficient market-based means of driving down emissions.
At COP, the UK is seeking an over-arching deal that it will hope to agree with all parties. The deal will need to tackle issues including cutting carbon emissions and money for countries to adapt to rising temperatures. This comes as UK pledges Â£290m to help poorer countries tackle the impact of climate change. It will go towards planning and investing in climate action, improving conservation and promoting low-carbon development in Asian and Pacific nations, the government says. Developing nations have called for financial help, arguing they are already suffering and will be worst affected by climate change. Follow updates on our live page.

267,COP26,Steffan Messenger,Climate change: Wales imports 'cause deforestation',2021-11-08,"A Brazilian tribal chief has warned Welsh soya imports could be responsible for ""not only deforestation but indigenous blood"".
Rivelino VerÃ¡ Gabriel said soy farming was wrecking the lifestyle of the South American nation's Mbya Guarani people.
It comes as the effect on deforestation by goods imported to Wales from high risk areas is exposed in a new report. 
It has led the Welsh government to promise action on products such as beef, soy and palm oil.
Mr Gabriel lives in Brazil's Atlantic Forest and is a coordinator of the Guarani Yvyrupa Commission, which brings together members of the Guarani people. 
Commenting on the report, he said: ""People who buy soya must know where it comes from, that there's strong traceability.
""They need to know whether this soya they're buying to feed a chicken from Wales, for instance, is coming from deforested areas in indigenous territories.""
Deforestation meant the ability of his people to survive was becoming increasingly hard, he said.
Rivers became polluted, traditional herbs could not be found, and hunting was made more difficult. 
Environment charities calculated an area 40% the size of Wales grew a handful of key commodities for it.
It has led to calls for climate change targets to be amended to take account of goods shipped in from abroad.
Charities WWF Cymru, Size of Wales and RSPB Cymru worked on the study.
They looked at cocoa, palm, beef, leather, natural rubber, soy, timber, pulp and paper imports. 
The report showed nearly a third of land used to grow these for Wales are in countries at high risk of deforestation, and exploitation of workers.
Carbon emissions linked to forest clearance to provide soy, cocoa, palm and rubber imports alone were equivalent to nearly a quarter of Wales' transport emissions every year.
An area five times Newport's size is used to grow soy for Wales.
The charities said Wales' people were contributing to deforestation by eating meat fed on such ""high-risk soy"".
Meanwhile, each year Wales uses land overseas the size of the Brecon Beacons to satisfy demand for beef.
More than a quarter (26%) is in countries at high risk of deforestation and labour exploitation.
The report advises the Senedd to encourage farmers to adopt nature and climate-friendly practices which do not rely on imported animal feed.
A strategy that drives and rewards traceable farm-to-fork supply chains is also urged.
The charities want the Welsh and UK governments to ensure post-Brexit trade deals guarantee high environmental and social standards.
Current Welsh targets to cut greenhouse gases and reach net zero only focus on domestic emissions so there is a drive for a report that accounts for those caused by imports.
WWF Cymru's Shea Buckland-Jones said Wales was having a ""catastrophic"" effect on the world's forests.
""We know what needs to be done and this report sets out some of the solutions,"" he said.
""Wales must act now by changing how we buy, consume and invest."" 
Size of Wales' deputy director, Barbara Davies Quy, said the COP26 summit was a chance for Wales to show leadership and take bold action.
""The Welsh government must seize this opportunity to drive positive change in our supply chains and commit to including deforestation free targets in all public sector spending,"" she said.
In COP26's first major deal last week, more than 100 leaders promised to end and reverse deforestation by 2030.  
The UK was among signatories. The charities say action is needed sooner.
Figures suggest almost 20% of the Amazon rainforest has been lost and, if another 5% goes, a tipping point could be triggered where it will not be able to sustain itself as a tropical rainforest.
Wales' climate change minister, Julie James, said the report was ""shocking"".
""We absolutely have to do something to diminish and hopefully eliminate our footprint abroad as well as at home.""
She was ""absolutely determined"" to change Welsh government procurement policy.
""We will also need to talk to all of our supermarkets and other purchasers across Wales to get everybody on board,"" she said.
Ms James said she had met with members of Peru's indigenous Wampis people at the conference. 
""They were telling me about the destruction of their native lands, the deforestation, completely unintended by people who don't really understand what they're buying,"" she said.
Changing climate change targets, she said, was something the Welsh government was ""determined to do"".
Cardiff burger restaurant Ansh has started taking action.
The meat for its burgers comes from their farm, where it uses sustainable methods to rear their animals.
""It's important that people question where produce comes from, where the meat comes from, where the food comes from,"" cook Aled Hill said.
""Because you don't know whether something you buy is causing huge damage overseas.""

268,COP26,James Cook,Can the food we eat help tackle climate change?,2021-11-08,"In a tiny, steamy building in East Lothian, oats are being whisked in a metal drum.
The cereal is classic Scottish fare, part of the nation's diet for centuries, but Josh Barton from the US state of Maine wants to make it the future of food and drink too.
""Worldwide Scotland is known for its whisky, it's known for its salmon. Scotland should also be known for its oat milk,"" he says at the East Linton base of his company, Brose.
Environmental activists who support that view have been making their voices heard on the streets of Glasgow during the COP26 conference, arguing that giving up meat and dairy is a key step in stabilising the climate.
By some estimates food production is responsible for a third of the greenhouse gas emissions which are driving shifts in global weather patterns. 
In four decades on Wester Braikie Farm near Arbroath in Angus, Amy Geddes says she has noticed big changes, with more obvious extremes.
""We're seeing far heavier rainfall episodes and we're seeing very dry springs and we're not getting the winters that we used to get in terms of cold and frost,"" she says.
Ms Geddes accepts that farming has a big impact on the environment but she also says that farmers understand better than anyone the need for sustainability.
Her arable farm, for example, has introduced new techniques such as an approach to planting crops which eschews ploughing and involves less soil disturbance.
""We're all recognising that a lot of our practices are unsustainable and that we'll need to look to alternatives,"" she says.
There are many areas to examine.
Tractors, combine harvesters and other vehicles pump out carbon dioxide; cows, sheep and other animals emit huge quantities of methane, as does the production of rice; and fertilisers give off nitrous oxide, all of which are trapping heat in the atmosphere, driving up global temperatures and altering weather patterns, according to a recent, landmark UN climate change report. 
In other words, says Jennie Macdiarmid, a professor in sustainable nutrition and health at Aberdeen University, farming is rapidly gobbling up the world's dwindling carbon budget.
In high income countries the main source of emissions is livestock, she says, agreeing with activists who want us to reduce meat and dairy consumption although Prof Macdiarmid warns that may lead to another problem.
There are far more plant-based processed foods on the shelves these days which the nutritionist says have a ""halo-type effect"" despite often being high in fat and salt content.
""It can be misleading,"" she warns.
Prof Macdiarmid isn't calling for everyone to immediately become vegetarian or vegan â ""we need to do it in baby steps,"" she says, but she does suggest that 20 years from now, we may be eating meat only once a week.
""I've got no beef with vegans at all,"" says Martin Kennedy, president of the National Farmers Union of Scotland, adding ""I just don't think anybody should be telling anybody else how they should be eating.""
Speaking in a byre as we shelter from a heavy autumn downpour on his farm near Aberfeldy, Perthshire, Mr Kennedy says he accepts that farming, like other industries, can do more to help the planet but he argues that the problem posed by Scottish agriculture is being exaggerated.
""Our emissions have dropped 18% since 1990 and that's continuing to improve,"" he says.
Mr Kennedy is especially dismissive of the method used to calculate methane emissions which more than 100 countries at COP26 have pledged to cut by 30% between now and 2030. 
Methane is more potent than the most prevalent greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, but it stays in the atmosphere for a shorter time and Mr Kennedy argues that the current method of assessing its impact fails to take that into account.
He supports Dr Michelle Cain and her colleagues at the University of Oxford who have suggested an alternative calculation which, if adopted, would result in a lower estimate for the climate effect of farming. 
In any case, argues the NFUS president, the carbon footprint of Scotland's dairy herd is a third less than elsewhere in Europe and two-thirds less than many other countries.
""Agriculture is getting hit with a stick that's not justified,"" says Mr Kennedy.
Where many farmers, scientists and climate campaigners agree though is on the importance of eating high quality, locally-sourced produce.
At St Paul's Community Garden in the east end of Glasgow volunteers are trying to encourage people who live in a deprived community to do just that.
""I would love to see people consume less meat and less dairy because it is such a massive contributor to climate change and it is destroying our planet,"" says Jamie McGurk, who works in the garden.
""It's easier said than done though because if you don't have the education, you don't have the budget, it can be more expensive,"" she says. ""So it's not always achievable.""
Ms McGurk says: ""Give us the budgets, and that goes across the board, that goes to the government, the politicians, the retailers.
""You want to make a difference? We'll make the difference, but then make everything affordable.""

269,COP26,Matt McGrath,COP26: Fossil fuel industry has largest delegation at climate summit,2021-11-08,"There are more delegates at COP26 associated with the fossil fuel industry than from any single country, analysis shared with the BBC shows.
Campaigners led by Global Witness assessed the participant list published by the UN at the start of this meeting. 
They found that 503 people with links to fossil fuel interests had been accredited for the climate summit.
These delegates are said to lobby for oil and gas industries, and campaigners say they should be banned.
""The fossil fuel industry has spent decades denying and delaying real action on the climate crisis, which is why this is such a huge problem,"" says Murray Worthy from Global Witness. 
""Their influence is one of the biggest reasons why 25 years of UN climate talks have not led to real cuts in global emissions.""
About 40,000 people are attending the COP. Brazil has the biggest official team of negotiators according to UN data, with 479 delegates. 
The UK, which is hosting the talk in Glasgow, has 230 registered delegates. 
So what counts as a fossil fuel lobbyist?
Global Witness, Corporate Accountability and others who have carried out the analysis define a fossil fuel lobbyist as someone who is part of a delegation of a trade association or is a member of a group that represents the interests of oil and gas companies.
Overall, they identified 503 people employed by or associated with these interests at the summit.
They also found that:
One of the biggest groups they identified was the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) with 103 delegates in attendance, including three people from the oil and gas company BP.
According to Global Witness, IETA is backed by many major oil companies who promote offsetting and carbon trading as a way of allowing them to continue extracting oil and gas. 
""This is an association that has an enormous number of fossil fuel company as its members. Its agenda is driven by fossil fuel companies and serves the interests of fossil fuel companies,"" Mr Worthy said. 
""What we seeing is the putting forward of false solutions that appear to be climate action but actually preserve the status quo, and prevent us from taking the clear, simple actions to keep fossil fuels in the ground that we know are the real solutions to climate crisis.""
The IETA says it exists to find the most efficient market-based means of driving down emissions. Members include fossil fuel companies but also a range of other businesses.
""We have law firms, we have project developers, the guys who are putting clean technology on the ground around the world, they're also members of our association as well,"" says Alessandro Vitelli, an IETA spokesman.
""We're not coming to a shuddering halt today and tomorrow, and suddenly there's going to be no emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels.""
""There is a process to transition that's under way, and carbon markets are the best way to make sure that transition takes place.""
Campaign groups argue that the World Health Organization didn't get serious about banning tobacco until all the lobbyists for the industry were banned from WHO meetings. They want the same treatment for oil and gas companies at COP.
""The likes of Shell and BP are inside these talks despite openly admitting to upping their production of fossil gas,"" said Pascoe Sabido of the Corporate Europe Observatory, who were also involved in the analysis. 
""If we're serious about raising ambition, then fossil fuel lobbyists should be shut out of the talks.""
The BBC asked the UN body responsible for accrediting delegates about its procedures, but has not received a reply.

271,COP26,James Williams,"We need to eat less meat, says Welsh minister Lee Waters",2021-11-07,"People should eat less meat in a bid to tackle climate change, according to a Welsh government minister.
But Lee Waters MS, Deputy Climate Change Minister, said when people do eat meat, it should be Welsh meat and ""better quality meat"".
Independent climate change advisors have suggested a 35% cut in meat consumption by 2050.
COP26 president Alok Sharma MP said it was a matter of ""personal choice"" as to whether people ate less meat.
The Welsh and UK governments have legally binding targets to reduce greenhouse emissions to net zero by 2050.
In its latest net zero plan, the Welsh government said its ambition over the next 20 years was to shift people's diet, meaning a ""substantial increase in fruit and vegetables, a decrease in red and processed meats and dairy products and a decrease in foods high in fat and sugar"".
The report references a recommendation from the independent Climate Change Committee that there should be a ""20% cut in meat and dairy consumption by 2030, rising to 35% by 2050 for meat only, with meat and dairy being replaced with plant based products"".
Asked on the BBC Politics Wales programme whether people should eat less meat, Mr Waters replied: ""Clearly, according to the science, we need to eat less meat. 
""The politics of that is hard. I think it's entirely compatible for us to say, 'eat less meat but the meat you do eat should be local meat and it should be better quality meat'.
""The problem our farmers have is competition from cheap imports. So, I think it's a way of achieving both of those things,"" he added.
It marks a change in stance from the Welsh government, after farming minister Lesley Griffiths MS said in September 2019 that she did not think people needed to eat less meat.
Wales' Climate Change Minister Julie James MS has previously said buying fruit and vegetables out of season should be seen as a luxury in the future. 
Speaking prior to the global climate change summit in Glasgow, UK government minister and COP26 president Mr Sharma said: ""I'm someone who very much believes in carrot rather than stick, trying to encourage people to move in the right direction.
""What we need to make sure as a government is that we are incentivising people to make decisions in the same way that we have grants to support people to buy ultra-low emission vehicles.""
A research paper recommending people ""shift dietary habits"" towards plant-based foods was hastily deleted from a UK government website by the Department for Business which said the paper was academic research and not official policy.

272,COP26,glas Fraser,COP26: How to spend Â£95 trillion,2021-11-07,"The Clyde is a source of affection and sometimes inspiration for Glasgow citizens, but rarely a source of warmth. That's changing. A couple of miles from the COP26 summit, the Innovation District created around Strathclyde University features plans to replace gas heating with the warmth that can be drawn from the river, even on a cold day.
Just as air and ground has heat that can be captured and used for buildings, Clydebank is already using the Clyde's water that way, and much of Glasgow's East End could benefit from the same technology.
Roddy Yarr, at Strathclyde University, is on a mission to spread the warmth as well as the message: 
""People will be able to access clean heat from the River Clyde using its ambient heat, distributing that within the area known as High Street, the original birthplace of Glasgow, and that would be made available to communities in the area.""
The cost? ""It starts around Â£210m. But if we think about communities around the district, such as Gorbals, Calton, Drygate, Townhead and Ladywell, you start to get into larger numbers of up to half a billion pounds.  That includes heat, providing grid resilience, and also transport and active travel. The whole city has to change and innovate to meet the carbon agenda in front of us.""
The project is just one of those in need of a lot money. Glasgow City Council has identified Â£30bn of projects like this, aiming to make the city net zero by 2030. 
Clearly, that kind of moola is not going to come from council tax. Grants from Holyrood won't be enough. This is one of many projects where the challenge of climate change can only be met by unlocking private money. And lots of it.
""The rate of return is not viable in the short term,"" says Yarr. ""A longer-term view is needed. A longer, perhaps slower return, with strong covenants made by the city, will enable that long-term investment to be made. That provides an investment horizon that is attractive to some investment funds - for instance, pension funds.""
Such projects are being given a colossal boost by the shift of investment funds to making the great energy transition work. Mobilising the finance sector to tackle climate change is a key element of the COP26 gathering. And at a mind-bending scale. 
Going into COP26, the concern was that governments in more prosperous nations have failed to meet their pledge to shift $100bn to poorer ones, to help them mitigate the effects of climate change, and to adapt to it. Yet that huge sum is chickenfeed in comparison with something called GFANZ - the Glasgow Finance Alliance for Net Zero.
If it turns out to be everything it claims, it could be worth 1300 times more than that target for transfers. At $130 trillion, or Â£95,000,000,000,000, it's an unimaginably large figure. If it helps, consider it nearly fifty times bigger than all the output in a year from the whole UK economy.
Some 450 financial institutions across 45 countries are signed up to making those funds available for the transition; asset managers, banks, pension funds are in there, including money they have already committed to backing companies with new products and technology, and building renewable power capacity, as well as much more investment required in the future.
Inside the United Nations blue zone of the COP26 summit, a lot of projects for cities, regions, and energy utilities are in search of funds, and a lot of funds are in search of quality investment opportunities.
""A mile wide and an inch deep,"" says one pressure group activist. Maybe so. The proof will have to be seen within very few years. And if the initiative succeeds in developing reliable, worldwide accounting standards for carbon impact, the evidence should be clear.
""It's hugely significant to have commitments at this scale from private sector banks and other financiers, because the scale of the need is in the multi-trillions of dollars,"" says Sir Danny Alexander - former Highland MP and senior figure in the UK government 10 years ago, who has spent the past five years as vice-president of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). 
""This can't be met from government budgets by themselves or from international financial institutions like the AIIB or World Bank,"" he says. ""It requires the crowding in of private capital at a very large scale.
""The key next step is: how can we make sure that we're develop the quality of projects necessary to enable that to flow in practice? We have the commitments. We now have to make those into reality in climate investment, especially in the developing world, where many climate financiers see risks that need to be dealt with.""
The former Lib Dem minister says business minds have been shifting fast. Business can see from governments' agenda at COP and beyond the scale of investment needed around the world, and so investors adapt to that. ""Plus institutions have seen their own investors putting pressure on them"".
He adds: ""Given the scale of need, there are huge opportunities for companies that get ahead of the game"". One message repeated often at COP is that climate change is not a cost and a burden that reduces living standards, but a source of future profit. 
By definition, no business leader wants to be left behind when opportunity knocks. They are also wise to avoid pressure to change from their consumers and activists, but some are slow to realise the implications for their own sectors.
Sian Sutherland is a London entrepreneur who set up A Plastic Planet, ""to ignite and inspire the world to turn off the plastic tap"". Leading one of the many pressure groups attending the COP, she told me of its campaign to highlight the 70% of fabrics in the world's clothing that are made from oil-based synthetic yarn. 
Going to fashion companies and retailers with the opportunity to get ahead of the campaign, with public commitments to shift to natural textiles and shape consumer trends, she was disappointed by the response. 
So she's going to banks and pension funds who sit behind the 20 or so plastics manufacturers who dominate the industry, and to textile companies: ""Finance is waking up to the power that it has"". And activists are getting smarter about using shareholdings to hit companies where they are required to respond.
(Some, at least at the high end of fashion, have long been on board: designer Stella McCartney was at the Kelvingrove Museum this week, extolling the virtues of a leather substitute made from mushroom roots.)
So the finance sector is responding to pressure and to opportunities. One of those with a sponsorship role at the COP is NatWest, formerly Royal Bank of Scotland, which claims Â£100bn of lending is to back green investment. Critics point to more than twice as much that is not committed that way, and ask what it's being used for. 
But according to finance director, Katie Murray: ""It's impacting everything we do - in our own operations and in how we lend to our customers, their transition plans, how we record within our financial statements, how we help our customers measure. 
""It's in my own executive remuneration, so it flows from the executive board all the way down through the organisation.""
The impact hits home: ""In terms of lending, we're looking to reduce the carbon impact of our balance sheet by 50% from 2030. We've got small exposure of 0.7% to traditional oil, gas and coal, but we've got a very big mortgage book, so one of the things we've been talking about in COP is the impact of the older traditional housing we live in. 
""We've been looking to how we move that to Energy Performance Certificate C and above (the more efficient ratings). We have discounted mortgages for A and B. So it's a question of how we shift that forward.""
That sort of thinking - attaching conditions to mortgages, or pricing them according to energy efficiency - could have a profound effect on the housing market, and potentially deliver better insulation more effectively than government action could require or afford.
As Britain's biggest business lender, NatWest is taking the message to 2 million customers, with both sticks and carrots: ""We worked out our targets for the four main sectors: agricultural, automotive, oil and gas, and our mortgage book, and we're going through our book sector by sector, and saying: who has the right transition plans, who needs help, how can we measure it?""
If there's no plan, there could be uncomfortable discussions with the bank manager
""We set up a great partnership with Microsoft to help businesses measure. If you're a midsize or small business, the task of measuring your output in carbon is a daunting task. It's incredibly technical"".  The NatWest finance director adds: ""I don't believe there's any industry that's untouched by what's going on this week.""
Some of the more unlikely candidates for green credentials are in Glasgow to say they want to be part of the story. Holcim, for example, is a gigantic Swiss-based manufacturer of cement, with a vast carbon footprint for its manufacturing processes and transport, even before it's poured into buildings and roads.
Chief executive Jen Jenisch was seeking out media exposure, to brush aside the demonisation of the sector and the threat of having to shrink what his company does. ""We have a great roadmap to decarbonise,"" he said.
""We have many steps to go there. We have relaunched new products with a reduced carbon footprint. We're very engaged in smarter designs for housing, with 3D printing where you use less material.""
Amid this giant green trade fair, Jenisch was in Glasgow to meet haulage firms, wanting to find out how they could cut his use of carbon in getting cement to where it's required. He says the future of a big manufacturing company could become more of a technology and recycling specialist - perhaps cutting tonnage but adding value: 
""We want to reduce the amount of fresh cement produced. We want to use a lot of mineral by-products, like demolition waste, to make the product sustainable. Recycling will be a big part of our future, where we can make old buildings into new ones.""
Back in the finance sector, insurance is re-pricing the risk from climate change as one driver of consumer behaviour - to keep buildings off flood plains, for instance, but with a disproportionate hit to poorer countries which are more exposed. Munich Re is very large insurer and re-insurer for other insurance firms, wielding its own investment funds.
Chief executive Joachim Wenning has signed up to be part of GFANZ, saying it is a ""very clear sign that the private sector is engaging and has to engage to help and enable the energy transition to combat climate change. It is important that it is visible the private sector is at the forefront of this development. 
""What we need to have is also government engagement. Private sector engagement alone will not bring the necessary transition. We need road maps from countries that clearly define what sort of renewables [they will have] and how fast they will build up, so that the private sector can invest into this road map.""
The insurer says that activists - making their noisy presence felt outside the blue zone as well as part of the conversation inside it - are necessary because of the failure of governments to lead. Beyond that, international links across campaign groups help to put pressure on governments that are slower to cut carbon emissions, such as China or India.
He reinforces a point I've been hearing from others about the pressure exerted on senior executives inside their organisations. At Holcim cement, Jen Jenisch said that his Zoom calls with staff across the 72,000-employee empire have recently been around 80% about climate change.
Dr Wenning at Munich Re says the younger generation in his company, and in others, ""is fiercely advocating combatting climate change. Fiercely. And they demand everything be done from the symbolic to fundamental, in personal behaviour and in how we invest.""
He broadens the point, with a plea: ""This generation tends to believe industry is the problem, because they are emitting. But they emit to make products we consume. We have to make the private sector part of the solution, and for this we need an economy-friendly environment, and not one where people put limits, limits, limits, prohibiting this and that. 
""We need the private sector to thrive and grow, but in a green, renewable context.""

273,COP26,Paul Pigott,Climate change: Fridge doors could save 1% of UK electricity use,2021-11-07,"The UK could cut its total electricity usage by 1% if the top five British supermarkets put doors on fridges, campaigners have said. 
Aldi has pledged to put fridge doors in all of its new UK stores, saving 2,000 tonnes of carbon a year.
Other supermarkets say they will try to make open fridges more efficient.
But the Environmental Investigation Agency said supermarkets could cut their electricity bills by an average of 33% by adding doors.
Each of Aldi's 100 new stores will save 20 tonnes of carbon per year by having doors on fridges, the German chain said, adding it would reduce stores' energy consumption by 20%.
Glamorgan Cricketer and environmental campaigner Joe Cooke says all supermarkets operating in Wales should follow suit.
""It's such a simple change,"" Cooke said. ""It could save so much energy, that's going to be so important for us as we try to decarbonise and make the changes to become a greener country.""
Cooke said only the Co-op and Aldi had committed to fridge doors in all their new and newly refurbished stores. 
Mary Dunn, Aldi UK's managing director of corporate responsibility, said: ""Introducing fridge doors is another step on that journey to reduce our energy consumption and we hope that customers enjoy the new, more sustainable shopping experience.""
But Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Waitrose and M&S all said they would be using ""air wall"" technologies that force cold air towards the back of open displays to save energy.
Lidl said is uses curtains when its stores are closed and Asda said it would be trialling doors on chilled displays in 2022.
Ulla Lindberg, a refrigeration and consumer researcher from Swedish fridge maker Haglund Industry, said fridges with doors outperform even the most efficient open cabinet technology.
Ms Lindberg's research found food shoppers were not turned off by doors, with many feeling the food was fresher. 
Supermarkets with fridge doors also saw less food waste and allowed supermarkets to cut their heating bills in winter because they need less heat in the chilled sections of their stores, Ms Lindberg said.
""Half of the energy in a supermarket is from the refrigeration so that means that you cut a lot [with doors],"" she explained.
""You can also improve the situation for the consumer and the food as well.""
The then Welsh Assembly's petitions committee considered a campaign to ban open refrigerators in supermarkets in 2019, but members concluded the Welsh government did not have the powers to intervene.
The UK government ruled out a ban on the use of open fridges and freezers in retail outlets in 2019 and said it was already taking action to improve energy efficiency.
In a statement, the the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it was ""looking at various ways to encourage greater energy efficiency in commercial refrigeration"". 
""We urge retailers to increase their use of energy-efficient technology wherever possible,"" it added.

The prime minister said countries must be ready to ""make the bold compromises and ambitious commitments needed"" at the final week of the climate summit.
Talks will continue in Glasgow, including on what is needed to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C.
Thousands of protesters gathered on Saturday in cities around the world.
About 100 climate change demonstrations were held in parts of the UK - including Glasgow, London and Cardiff - while events also took place in Kenya, Turkey, France, Brazil, Australia and Canada. 
Glasgow's rally was the largest the city had ever seen, police said, with about 100,000 people taking part.
The police arrested 21 scientists at the march. The individuals arrested had chained themselves together and blocked a road bridge to the River Clyde. 
Meanwhile, in a new development, Environment Secretary George Eustice - who is at the summit - has suggested the government is looking at introducing a carbon border tax.
This would be a tax on goods - such as food, mobile phones or cement - coming to the UK from countries that do not meet the UK's obligations on climate action.
He told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show it would take time to do and ideally would be done multilaterally.
""We are not going to export pollution,"" he said. ""If you don't want to do that, you do want to consider something like a carbon border tax.""
Last week, world leaders attended the first half of COP26 and a series of announcements were made, including:
The parts of the Paris Agreement - the world's first comprehensive deal to tackle climate change - that still need finalising involve markets for trading carbon emissions, transparency over what countries are doing, and common timeframes for action.
Discussions will also continue on negotiations on finance for poor countries to adapt to a changing climate as well as on a ""cover decision"" pledge from the summit. This will set out how countries will close the gap between the action to cut emissions they have pledged and what is needed to avoid dangerous temperature rises of more than 1.5C.
The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods and forest fires are already becoming more intense. But unless more is done, the planet is already on course to warm by more than 2C by the end of this century.
Several countries, as well as UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres, want accelerated action on emissions cuts this decade to keep the 1.5C goal alive.
Experts and climate change campaigners have welcomed the commitments, but argued they need to be delivered on  - warning a previous deal in 2014 had ""failed to slow deforestation at all"".
Similarly, activists have argued the deal on coal ""falls well short of the ambition needed"", as the ""small print gives countries enormous leeway"" to choose when to phase out the fossil fuel. 
Mr Johnson said: ""There is one week left for COP26 to deliver for the world, and we must all pull together and drive for the line.""
He said nations had brought ""ambition and action to help limit rising temperatures"", and referred to the pledges that have been made during COP26 - including on deforestation and methane emissions.
""But we cannot underestimate the task at hand to keep 1.5C alive,"" he added.
""Countries must come back to the table this week ready to make the bold compromises and ambitious commitments needed.""
Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband has warned the world is a ""long way off"" where it needs to be to take the ""major steps"" to ensure global warming does not exceed 1.5C.
The Labour MP urged the prime minister to personally head up the negotiations in the final days of COP26, rather than engaging in ""empty exhortation and commentary"".
He said: ""We have a right to expect him to engage directly in these final days, personally driving these negotiations forward, pushing all the major emitters to do more, delivering the finance required for developing and vulnerable countries and ensuring we have a path out of Glasgow to keep 1.5 alive.
""He needs to step up with focus, clarity and urgency in the face of the massive task the world faces in the coming days.""
COP26 president Alok Sharma said the billions of dollars to restore the natural world that had been promised during the first week of the summit was humanity's ""first line of defence"" against the crisis.
He told a news conference in Glasgow on Saturday that if the world reaches global warming of 1.5C above industrial levels, 70% of coral reefs would be lost.  If it gets to 2C, they would all die, he said.
Mr Sharma said the UK will provide Â£500m to protect more than five million hectares of tropical rainforests and create thousands of green jobs across Africa, Asia and Latin America.
The UK is also launching a Â£65m Just Rural Transition support programme to help communities move towards more sustainable methods of agriculture and food production, he added.

Activists speaking at Saturday's climate change march in Glasgow included Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate, actor Idris Elba and representatives of indigenous people.
Ms Nakate told the crowd: ""The climate and ecological crises are already here. But so are citizens from around the globe.
""Leaders rarely have the courage to lead. It takes citizens, people like you and me, to rise up and demand action. And when we do that in great enough numbers, our leaders will move.""

""Even some people who didn't believe in climate change, they have started to believe after seeing my work.
""I know it's important I must do this and I must say the truth and say what I feel.""
Prof Davies, from the UEA's School of Environmental Sciences, said: ""Many of these paintings show the decline of glaciers, ice sheets and large areas of permafrost.
""He portrays these in a way that engages people; Gennadiy can capture that sort if imagery and it fires people up.""

277,Climate change,BBC News,Climate change: Wales' carbon zero targets 'down to politics',2021-11-07,"Zero carbon targets can only be met by 2050 if the Welsh and UK governments communicate more effectively, an academic has said.
Dr Neal Hockley, of Bangor University, said Wales' chances of meeting the targets were ambitious but largely down to the ""politics of the issue"".
The Welsh government agreed working with Westminster is ""very important"".
But it said it was ""disappointing and frustrating"" that the UK government had not shared its climate strategy.
A spokesman added: ""Despite us participating in good faith in various workshops and with requests for information over the last several years, the UK government did not choose to share its net zero strategy with us in a meaningful way or timeframe ahead of publication.
""It made it impossible to ensure the Welsh and UK strategies were coherent.
""We agree that the UK and devolved governments need each other to enable and support delivery of our ambitious climate targets and would remind the UK government that transparency and collaboration, as captured by the COP theme of 'working together', is very important.""
A UK government spokesman said: ""We worked closely with the Welsh government to develop the Net Zero Strategy - our comprehensive, UK-wide plan to cut pollution, deploy clean energy and create jobs in new industries. 
""The UK government will continue to engage regularly with the devolved administrations as we work together to end our country's contribution to climate change by 2050.""
Last week, the Welsh government published its latest update on its vision to become carbon free by 2050.
However Dr Hockley, a senior lecturer in environmental economics and policy, said he did not think either the UK government or the Welsh government were clear on how to reach the net zero target by 2050.
""I don't think there's a fully concrete plan to get us to 2050, to net zero,"" he told BBC Wales' Politics Wales programme.
""In fairness to the Welsh government, a lot of the policy tools that are going to be required to get us there lie with the UK government.
""It's clear there's not brilliant communication between the UK government and the Welsh government on these issues, and that's something that's going to have to change."" 
He added: ""There are so many unknowns and too many hard decisions that need to be taken if we were to get to net zero by 2050 that haven't yet been taken.
""That will depend on the politics of the issue and I'm not going to try and predict politics.""

Lord Deben, chair of the independent climate change committee, told BBC Wales he thought the UK government had historically not been good at working with the other nations or regional government.
He said: ""I very much hope the accession for Michael Gove as communities and levelling up secretary will mean they will go to some real effort to get a much better partnership between the central government, the nationalities and local government.
""I use Wales as the example of this because the Welsh government has built a relationship with local government, which is exemplary - better than anywhere else in the United Kingdom.""

278,COP26,Adam Durbin,Climate change: National Trust joins international call for peat product ban,2021-11-07,"The National Trust is calling on the government to ban peat being used in compost, as part of efforts to try and limit climate change.
It is one of more than a dozen international organisations asking for a switch to sustainable alternatives. 
Peat bogs are a carbon sink - meaning they soak up carbon dioxide emissions that exacerbate global warming.
The UK government has already said it intends to ban the sale of peat compost to the public in England by 2024.
But in a joint statement on peat, the National Trust and the National Trust for Scotland - as well as similar groups including from the Irish Republic, Korea and Indonesia - urged the government to ""act now"" and ban the sale of peat products in horticulture entirely.
They made the call to coincide with the COP26 climate summit negotiations.
Peat is the surface layer of soil, made up primarily of partially decomposed plant material which has developed in waterlogged and low oxygen conditions. This water-holding capacity, and the fact it is relatively inert, make it ideal for plant growth, where it is often used in compost, as well as harvested and burned as fuel. 
Research shows peatland traps almost twice as much carbon as forests, despite covering just 3% of the earth's surface. 
But peat bogs that have been drained, dug up for fuel or used in compost have the opposite effect and contributes to carbon emissions.
The National Trust said healthy peatlands also help to control flooding and encourage vegetation that can provide homes for wildlife.
The organisation, which is one of the largest landowners in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said it was taking action to eliminate the use of peat in its gardens and supply chains.
National Trust director general Hilary McGrady said the international organisations were ""all taking action"" to eliminate the use of peat, but added ""we can't end this practice alone"".
She called on members to ""make a positive choice for climate and for nature"" and buy peat-free compost to use in their gardens, as well as check whether plants they buy are peat free.
Ms McGrady said: ""It is through this sort of collective effort that we can unite in the fight against climate change.
""We also need government to step up and play their part by bringing in legislation that bans the sale of products containing peat.""
Leading garden centres in the UK have been found to be failing to stop the sale of peat in compost, despite pressure from campaigners and government.
Last year countryside charity CPRE warned emissions from UK peatland could cancel out all carbon reductions  made through new and existing forests.
Correction 16th November: We have amended this article to remove an inaccurate description of peat as ""filled with nutrients"" and make clear that its popularity in horticulture relates to its water-holding capacity and relatively inert state.

279,COP26,Matt McGrath,COP26: Time to sober up,2021-11-07,"So how much progress has really been made in the opening days of COP26 and what are the main challenges that lie ahead?
To paraphrase COP26 president Alok Sharma, this is the moment when the rubber is finally meeting the road. 
After a first week dominated by a blizzard of announcements of new initiatives in the real world, the conference is now moving into the critical, behind doors phase of the negotiations.
The main focus will still be on devising a plan to bend the temperature curve below 1.5C.
There has been quite a bit of speculation that the first week announcements made by countries and the new pledges on methane and coal have already moved the needle on the rise in global temperatures that's likely this century. 
According to the head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, the new commitments mean that the mercury rise may be held to 1.8C. 
At the start of the COP the latest analysis from the UN suggested a rise of 2.7C. 
So just how real is this large predicted drop?
""None of the countries that has a net zero target has implemented sufficient short term policies to put itself on a trajectory towards net zero,"" said Dr Niklas HÃ¶hne, from the New Climate Institute, who monitor and assess national carbon cutting plans.
""Right now it's more a vision, or imagination. And it's not matched by action.""
As one participant explained it, the first week of COP26 was all sugar rush, the second will be about sobering up and getting down to business. 
Next week will see ministers fly in from around the world to tackle the tricky issues that negotiators themselves can't resolve. 
These will encompass a range of technical issues relating to the Paris agreement that have been outstanding for a number of years, including the rules on how carbon markets work, on the need for transparent reporting, and for common time frames on emission cutting plans. 
Some progress has been reported, but there are still wide gaps between the parties across these questions.
As deadlines loom, negotiators are getting nervous.
""It is tense right now, people are having to take tough decisions, as they should,"" said Archie Young, the UK's lead negotiator in the talks. 
""I think it is really important that we recognise the hard work that goes into the importance of some of that technical work.""
There will also be detailed and tough discussions around finance, around the question of adaptation, and loss and damage. 
There is likely to be a real standoff over the question of how cash for climate change is spent. 
Despite repeated calls from developing countries for a larger share of the finance to be used to help them to adapt to higher temperatures, the focus according to observers is still on using the money to help them cut emissions. 
The cold reality is that investors are more willing to put their money into renewable energy projects where a profit can be made than they are to spend it on sea walls or other adaptive measures that do not guarantee a return.
""Rich countries publicly claim they care about adaptation but inside the talks most of the money goes on emission reductions and they undermine efforts to prioritise the adaptation needs of vulnerable nations,"" said Mohamed Adow, from the Power Shift Africa organisation, an observer at these talks. 
The failure of the richer nations to fulfil their promise of $100bn by 2020 has undoubtedly damaged trust, there is work underway to put in place a new, more substantial payment from 2025. 
While the new figure is unlikely to be agreed here, the prospect of a very significant increase could go some way towards ensuring that finance doesn't derail these talks completely.
For the UK though the really big question is how to construct a final document that will be agreed collectively by the conference that will keep the 1.5C temperature threshold within reach. 
UK negotiators are taking soundings on what's termed a ""cover decision"", a package of measures that will try to close the gap between what the world's commitments add up to and the 1.5C bar. 
The key element of that package will be an attempt to get countries to update and improve their carbon cutting plans more regularly than every five years as is presently the case. 
The most vulnerable want an annual update. There's also a push for countries to come back with new plans in two years time.
There is likely to be strong opposition from larger, developing economies. But there is a belief that steps will be agreed.
""You clearly want some processes agreed here that give us hope that countries are going to come back and sharpen their pencils and put more ambition on the table,"" said Alden Meyer, a long time participant in climate talks from the E3G think tank.
""I think if we get the atmospherics, right and the UK uses the ministers well, by the end of next week, we can get substantial movement.""
""It will offer some hope that over the next couple of years, we can start to really close that gap.""

281,COP26,BBC News,COP26: Thousands march for Glasgow's biggest protest,2021-11-06,"About 100,000 people marched in Glasgow to demand more action on the climate crisis, organisers have said.
The protest was the biggest so far during the COP26 summit and took place alongside hundreds of similar events around the world.
Greta Thunberg joined the march but did not speak, leaving activists such as Vanessa Nakate to address a rally.
Police arrested 21 scientists who chained themselves together and blocked a road bridge over the River Clyde. 
Officers also contained a group of socialist activists after pyrotechnics were set off during the march - one person was then arrested.
However the force said the day passed ""largely without incident"". 
This video can not be played
The ""Global Day of Action for Climate Justice"" march started at Kelvingrove Park in the west of the city and Queen's Park in the south at about midday and made its way along a pre-agreed three-mile route to Glasgow Green.
About 100 climate change demonstrations were held in other parts of the UK while events were also taking place in a further 100 countries including Kenya, Turkey, France, Brazil, Australia and Canada.
In London, protesters marched from the Bank of England to Trafalgar Square while another large demonstration happened in Cardiff. 
The opening speeches at the protest rally at Glasgow Green came from representatives of indigenous people around the globe.
Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate later told protesters: ""The climate and ecological crises are already here. But so are citizens from around the globe.
""Leaders rarely have the courage to lead. It takes citizens, people like you and me, to rise up and demand action. And when we do that in great enough numbers, our leaders will move.""
It was understood that Greta Thunberg decided to give space to other speakers as she had already addressed youth activists in a march and rally on Friday.
Away from the march, 21 protesters from Scientist Rebellion were arrested after chaining themselves together on the King George V Bridge in Glasgow city centre.
Charlie Gardner, an associate senior lecturer at Durell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, said scientists could not ""rely on our leaders to save us anymore"" and had a ""moral duty to act"".  
He tweeted: ""Over 15,000 scientists declared that we're in a climate emergency, but most aren't acting as if it's an emergency.
""We're taking this action to encourage others, scientists and all people, to rise up in rebellion against the system that is killing everything.""
Police Scotland closed the bridge to pedestrians and vehicles during the protest. 
A spokesperson said: ""We have facilitated a peaceful protest, but to balance right to protest with public safety and rights of the wider community, our protest removal team is safely removing protesters.""
After the event at Glasgow Green dispersed, Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie said the atmosphere had been ""generally good natured"", with people in ""high spirits"".
He confirmed one person had been arrested after a socialist group was contained and a further 21 were arrested following the King George V Bridge incident.
He said: ""Glasgow has today hosted a public protest the size and scale of which was beyond anything many of us - both within and outwith policing - can ever remember. I am pleased to say today has passed largely without incident. 
""I want to thank the vast majority of those who attended both the Youth March and the Climate March for their positive attitudes and for following instructions from our officers.""
Despite the grim weather there was a carnival atmosphere at the start of the march in Kelvingrove Park, with one group playing steel drums to entertain the crowd. 
Flags and banners were blowing in the wind and most activists were sporting multiple layers in a bid to combat the cold and rain.
One enterprising local vendor who was selling whistles at the youth march on Friday was today offering ponchos for Â£3.
There was a heavy police presence and officers paid particular attention to a group of socialist activists dressed in black and wearing red face masks. 
Members of the group were still being closely monitored more than five hours later when they were among the last to arrive at Glasgow Green.
A helicopter hovered overhead as the demonstration snaked through the west end and city centre.
One group set off a red flare in Finnieston but the march was good natured throughout and I saw no signs of any trouble.
The event was the largest protest in Glasgow since the Stop the Iraq War march in 2003 and groups representing a broad spectrum of causes, ranging from indigenous people to refugees, made for a colourful spectacle.
They were entertained along the way by acts including a bagpiper and a man singing karaoke dressed as Darth Vadar.
One of the highlights was a spontaneous outbreak of applause which greeted the marchers as they arrived in George Square.
It was summed by a banner which read: ""Glasgow Welcomes Climate Activists"".
The sun had come out by the time the mass protest arrived at Glasgow Green and some revellers even enjoyed a dance party outside the High Court in Glasgow.
But the huge crowd was later left disappointed when it emerged celebrated climate activist Greta Thunberg would not be addressing the rally.  
World leaders and representatives who came to Glasgow for the climate change summit have so far made promises to curb deforestation, phase out coal, end funding for fossil fuels abroad and cut methane emissions.
But there is still a significant gap between the measures countries have committed to and what is needed to avoid more than 1.5C of warming, beyond which the worst floods, droughts, storms and rising seas of climate change will be felt.
Countries are under pressure to agree on actions for the next decade, finance loans for developing countries to cope with the crisis and finalise the last parts of how the global Paris Agreement on climate change will work.
Asad Rehman, a spokesperson for the COP Coalition, said: ""We are taking to the streets across the world this weekend to push governments from climate inaction to climate justice. 
""This has been the least accessible climate summit ever - with so many people side-lined at the talks or not able to make it in the first place. Today those people are having their voices heard.""
Representatives of indigenous communities from North and South America joined the march in Glasgow. 
Some have no formal representation at COP26, despite living at the frontline of environmental destruction caused by mining or deforestation, because they are not recognised by their governments. 
Marchers came from across the UK to take part in the Glasgow march, including surfers from Cornwall.
Edinburgh COP Coalition put on 13 coaches to travel to the event while a series of ""Pedal on COP26"" bike rides were organised from more than 20 areas of Scotland, the longest rides being from Inverness, Aberdeen and Dumfries setting off on Friday.
The cyclists brought up the rear of the march, which took near two hours to leave Kelvingrove Park, making the line of protesters almost two miles (3.2km) long.
Police said they blocked a section of the crowd between Holland Street and St Vincent Street because of ""congestion issues"". 
""Following an escalation in their conduct a small number of people from the group who deliberately stopped on the parade route at the junction of Holland Street and St Vincent Street were contained by police on the grounds of public safety,"" a Police Scotland tweet said. 
Bleak weather with heavy showers and gusts of wind greeted early arrivals to the march, but the weather improved over the afternoon. 
High winds, however, continued to cause a problem, hampering efforts to set up the main stage at Glasgow Green. and speakers instead used the stage company's lorry as a platform. 
Saturday's march came after many young activists - including striking school pupils - took part in a mass demonstration in the city on Friday.
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

A brass band joined the march which left Millennium Square and weaved through the city centre as similar events were held across the world. 
Among protesters were children and NHS staff uniting around the same message.
Demonstrations have also been held at airports Leeds Bradford and Doncaster Sheffield. 
The events come midway through the COP26 summit in Glasgow and were aimed at  increasing pressure on world leaders attending the conference on climate change.
Chloe Harrison, 23, said the Leeds protest was the first she had ever attended but felt ""compelled"" to join.
""Climate change is a daily existential crisis for me and my generation,"" she said. 
""Knowing that the planet is withering away at our fingertips is a dreadful, hopeless feeling as one day humans may eventually not be here for anything to have ever mattered at all.

Campaigners from the Group for Action on Leeds Bradford Airport staged a rally there calling for all airport expansions to be ""stopped immediately"".
Chris Foren, chairman of the group, said: ""For decades, the aviation industry has promised that its techno-fixes will make everything alright. 
""But that's never happened and it's not going to happen in the nine years we have left to stop climate breakdown. 
""Maybe, one day, we'll be able to fly in large, long haul, zero emission aircraft but we know that's not an option in the foreseeable future. We simply have to stop expanding all airports - now.""
World leaders gathered in Glasgow have so far made promises to curb deforestation, phase out coal, end funding for fossil fuels abroad and cut methane emissions.

Campaigners are protesting in Cardiff and other UK cities as leaders meet at the COP26 summit in Glasgow.
Wales' rugby team host South Africa at the Principality Stadium while Cardiff City host Huddersfield in the football, with 100,000 expected in the city.
People have been advised to leave plenty of time and wear face masks in busy areas.
Climate change activists are also marching in Swansea, Bangor, Llangollen and Holyhead while the Cardiff demonstration will finish in a rally outside the Senedd.
The 200 countries at the COP26 conference were asked cut emissions by 2030 and to keep global warming to 1.5C to avoid a climate catastrophe - before reaching net zero in 2050.
""More people than ever now realise behaviour change is only part of the solution as we can only ever make changes within the capitalist systems and infrastructure we are given,"" said Cardiff demonstration organiser Clare James.
""We know that COP26 is unlikely to deliver the solutions we need, so we're encouraging everyone to join us and demand a system change for future generations, because it's what we do together once COP26 is over that will be more important.""
The demonstration in Cardiff started outside City Hall at noon before hearing speeches from campaigners outside the Welsh Parliament building in Cardiff Bay.
Wales' future generations commissioner Sophie Howe said while ""we have seen solid actions from governments, there's a lot more we need to do"".
""Please don't underestimate the power of your actions,"" she said in a message to activists.

""It is the power of citizens from across the world who are scrutinising their governments and holding them to account.
""Working together to make sure we're holding policy makers to account, I believe there is a real chance in Wales that we can and will say we're acting today for a better tomorrow.""
At the march in Cardiff, which was attended by about 1,000 people, Meriel Harrison who works for the RSPB wildlife charity said: ""Nature and the climate emergency are so interlinked.
""We're not going to help one without solving the other. 
""It's nature day at COP26 today in Glasgow so it's important we stand up for nature and make sure that nature's voice is heard in the climate negotiations.""
Mariska from Cardiff, who attended the event with her two daughters Maia, five, and Vesper, three, said her eldest was ""very interested in climate change"".
""As a mother I think it's a good thing to take my kids to and educate them,"" she said.
Cardiff, Glasgow, London and 14 other UK cities are marching for ""just and fair solutions"" to the crisis as the United Nations climate talks continue in Scotland.
Across Wales, rallies are taking place in Bangor, with others expected in Llangollen, Newtown, Pontypridd, Swansea and Ruthin while there will be a tiny forest planting day in Caerphilly.
The march in Bangor started from the city's pier and included a range of speakers, including scientists and campaigners from Friends of the Earth Cymru and Bangor and Conwy Extinction Rebellion.
""The impacts of runaway climate change are almost too awful to contemplate, and the people who will be worst hit are typically those who have done the least to cause the problem,"" organisers said.
The protests and sports events could have an impact on local infrastructure - and, in Cardiff, some roads immediately around the Principality Stadium were shut at 07:00 ahead of the Wales rugby international. 
There is a full Cardiff city centre road closure from 13:30 until 20:30 around the game which kicks off at 17:30.
Public transport operators have warned trains and buses are expected to be busier than normal and Transport for Wales has warned social distancing ""is not going to be possible on the majority of match-day"" trains.
Face coverings are mandatory on public transport in Wales - unless you are exempt - to help prevent the spread of Covid while Welsh Rugby Union bosses have warned fans they must also wear masks inside the Principality Stadium.
TfW has promised ""additional capacity"" on their busiest routes into Cardiff on Saturday with ""all available carriages in service"".
It added: ""We have measures in place to keep passengers safe including hand sanitiser at stations, enhanced cleaning regimes on trains and stations and queuing systems to control the flow of people into stations and on to trains.
""It is vital customers allow plenty of time to get into Cardiff prior to kick-off and familiarise themselves with the post-event queuing systems.""
After last Saturday's Wales rugby game in Cardiff, the health minister said she was concerned what ""Christmas will look like if we see the kind of scenes that we saw in Cardiff on the weekend everywhere in Wales"".
Eluned Morgan told the Senedd on Tuesday that if rates continue to go up then Covid passes will be required for pubs and restaurants.
It comes as First Minister Mark Drakeford warned scrapped Covid restrictions could be brought back in at the Welsh government's next review on 19 November so people could have a ""normal"" Christmas.
Although infection rates are falling, Wales has the UK's highest Covid case rate, but coronavirus hospital admissions remain relatively low. 
However, there are 73 Covid patients in critical care beds and these are the highest levels since February.

288,COP26,BBC News,COP26: Why we marched in Glasgow,2021-11-06,"Tens of thousands of people have braved the wet and windy conditions in Glasgow to take part in the biggest mass protest of the COP26 summit.
A huge column of activists made its way from Kelvingrove Park to the city centre, and on to a rally on Glasgow Green. 
Some of them explained why they felt it was so important to be there. 
Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage, has travelled to Glasgow from Cornwall for the rally. 
The 46-year-old said: ""The ocean is front and centre of the impact of climate change but it is also part of the solution.""
He said the charity's supporters were taking part in events across the country to highlight the impact of human and plastic waste. 
He added: "" I think campaigners are having an effect and I believe the next decade will be the most radical period of environmental action the world has ever seen.""
Retired designer Charlie Rohan travelled from Edinburgh to take part in the march. 
He made his own sign for the occasion but as the rain lashed down he admitted: ""The cardboard is getting heavier by the minute.""
Asked why he made the journey, the father-of-two said: ""This is our last chance. If we don't take action now then COP 27, 28 and 29 will be a waste of time.""
The 61-year-old is a keen walker and expressed dismay at the amount of rubbish he encounters washed up on Scotland's coastlines. 
He added: ""The UK says it is a leader on climate change but we need to follow that through.""
Ruby Hembrom is on the march to raise awareness of the plight of people in India. 
She said: ""When you look at climate change the most vulnerable people will be the most impacted. 
""Indigenous people are forced from the forests due to coal and mining projects. 
""The consequences are devastating.""
The London-based student was joined by Sophie Grig, senior campaigner with Survival International. 
The group works to support native groups across the world, especially those who face persecution and displacement.
She said: ""We have to stop burning and extracting fossil fuels.
""And we have to end the suffering of indigenous communities.""
Amalen S has travelled to Glasgow from Malaysia with Friends Of The Earth International, campaigning against carbon markets.
To illustrate their point they have built a large ""carbon unicorn"" head - Amalen tells the BBC it emits smoke when up and running.
""Carbon market is the same thing as chasing a carbon unicorn, it sounds amazing but it doesn't exist,"" said Amalen.
The group has organised a number of demos throughout the summit, including one at the SEC on Friday.
Amalen is also part of The Artivist Network and his work involves helping people express their views on climate change through artwork.
""A lot of lobbying happens behind closed doors,"" he added.
Glasgow students Xavier, Ben, Sophie and Abby were giving out flyers for Beyond the Green, an event with live music and speakers promoting sustainability and the use of hemp during COP26.
Ben, who studies sound production, said: ""It's a great material to use instead of non-biodegradeables. It can be used to create anything from houses, rope, clothes and food.""
He added climate change is something he has always thought about, and tried his best to recycle and go ""beyond the bare minimum"" to live sustainably.
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

The bog is located on the shores of Lough Bradan in County Tyrone, which supplies the Omagh and Drumquin areas with water. 
It is part of a restoration project by NI Water, in partnership with the Forest Service. 
Using a technique called cell bunding, the Lough Bradan bog now retains water in the underlying peat, and filters what goes into the lough. 
Rebecca Allen from NI Water said: ""Cell bunding encourages the regrowth of important water-retaining mosses and raise the water table.  
""This slows the flow into the Lough from surrounding areas, which will filter the water flowing to the Lough for years to come.""
The area has returned to a functioning bog meaning it will have wider environmental impacts by retaining carbon in the form of peat. 
Ms Allen added: ""Healthy bogs can provide a nature-based solution to climate change, so itâs fantastic that this bog in County Tyrone is now part of that.""
Those behind the project hope that Lough Bradan will serve as a model for future forest to bog restoration projects in Northern Ireland.

291,COP26,Rob England,COP26: Where have emissions fallen the most in England?,2021-11-06,"Parts of England are thought to have seen a reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by more than 80% over 15 years, official estimates show.
Between 2005 and 2019 Northumberland saw the biggest percentage drop in emissions per person, at 83%.
But experts say the change is not a complete picture, as industries shift overseas rather than decarbonising.
The UK has committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 and is currently hosting COP26.
The summit, held in Glasgow, aims to bring political leaders and delegates from around the world together to make plans for tackling climate change.
Government estimates suggest the UK's CO2 emissions fell by about a third over 15 years, and all individual local authority areas saw a reduction.
This was driven mainly by changes in the fuel used to generate electricity at power stations, and the closure of industrial plants.
CO2 made up 80% of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK in 2019. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the planet.
In Northumberland the drop in estimated emissions, from 12.5 tonnes of CO2 per person to 2.1, was due to the closure of industrial sites such as Lynemouth's aluminium smelting plant in 2012.
The area's forests and grassland also had a substantial impact by absorbing more CO2 from the atmosphere than releasing it, compared to other places.
Meanwhile, emissions in High Peak, which forms part of the Peak District in Derbyshire, are still dominated by industry, with only a 16% fall over 15 years.
The area is home to Hope Cement Works, a large local employer. In 2019 emissions stood at 31.9 tonnes of CO2 per person, down from 38.1 in 2005. 
Cement is an ingredient in concrete, the production of which is thought to account for about 8% of CO2 emissions globally, substantially more than the aviation industry, which makes up about 2.5%.
Breedon Group, the operators of Hope Cement Works, said cement was an ""essential ingredient of the infrastructure on which modern society depends"" but added it recognised the carbon emissions in its products and was committed to continue to reduce these by developing ""more sustainable"" options.
Though experts say an overall reduction in emissions across the UK is a good sign, they also warn the loss of emissions purely in the manufacturing industry - as seen in areas like Northumberland - could be negatively affecting the UK's overall carbon footprint.
Dr Jonathan Radcliffe from the University of Birmingham said the current emissions estimates ""only tell part of the story"" as the data measures where carbon emissions occur, and do not include the emissions attached to products bought in the UK but made elsewhere.
""Over 40% of the UK's overall carbon footprint comes from emissions associated with imported goods,"" he said.
""Growing the manufacturing base in the UK could reduce the UK's carbon footprint, as we progressively decarbonise, which should be recognised in how we account for emissions at a national scale, and incentives for companies to invest.""
Paul Brannen, a former MEP for the North East of England who sat on the EU Parliament's Environment, Public Health and Food Safety committee, said the drop in Northumberland's emissions was the last stages of a deindustrialisation process which started in the 1970s and had a ""devastating impact on communities"".
He said heavy industry, and its associated hefty emissions, had ""pretty much gone"" from the area after a long history which began during the industrial revolution.
""What we now need to do, and have been doing, is...make use of the knowledge we've gained from our history and deploy that into new, greener technologies,"" he said.
Mr Brannen said new industries such as the testing of wind turbine blades in Blyth were a good example of ""building on our existing knowledge, but in a process that doesn't involve a large amount of emissions"".
""It draws on the region's historic constructions skills, used to build the Tyne Bridge, and also the heavy mechanical and electrical engineering skills developed in the shipbuilding industry.""
Northumberland County Council formally declared a climate emergency in 2019, alongside many other local authorities in England.
Council Leader Glen Sanderson said since heavy industry was largely dismantled the county had seen a ""renaissance"" of green businesses, including an electric car battery plant, an under-sea power cable project and offshore wind farms.
He added that the council sought to encourage and support skills and training initiatives needed to grow employment opportunities in green companies, and unemployment issues seen in previous decades due to the decline in manufacturing were now at a ""relatively low level"".
Mr Sanderson said the council intends to improve the uptake of electric vehicle charging points, launch further tree planting schemes and encourage residents to ""do the best [they]can"" to lower emissions in homes through insulation and heat pumps - an alternative to fossil fuel heating.

292,Climate change,Joseph Lee,COP26: Supermarkets promise to halve environmental impact by 2030,2021-11-06,"Five of the UK's biggest supermarkets have promised to halve the environmental impact of a weekly food shop by the end of the decade.
Tesco, Sainsbury's, Waitrose, Co-op and M&S said they would reduce carbon emissions, deforestation and the food waste and packaging they produce.
Their efforts will be monitored by the WWF conservation group.
""Food production is one of the biggest threats to our planet,"" said WWF chief executive Tanya Steele said.
The chief executives of the supermarkets, which together serve more than half of UK food shoppers, said in a joint statement: ""We recognise that a future without nature is a future without food. By 2030 we need to halt the loss of nature.""
Before the end of next year, they also promised to set science-based targets for how they would help to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures.
This is a key target for world leaders at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, with scientists saying it must be met to avoid the worst effects of climate change.
Currently, the world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods and forest fires are already becoming more intense. Unless more is done, the planet is already on track to warm by more than 2C by the end of this century.
The food industry is responsible for more than a quarter of total greenhouse gas emissions and almost 60% of the global damage to biodiversity, so minimising its impact could make a significant contribution to reducing climate change.
Each year, the industry emits 17.3bn tonnes of carbon dioxide - about 19 times more than commercial planes.
About a quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, forestry and other land use - and experts say the way food is grown and consumed needs reforming.
Ms Steele from the WWF said the world could only tackle the ""climate and nature emergency"" if food retailers played their part.
""The promises these CEOs have made are game-changing and we hope other food retailers will follow in their footsteps, so that every shopper can be confident that the products they buy aren't fuelling the climate crisis and pushing precious wildlife closer to the brink,"" she said.
Later, as the COP26 summit continues, it is expected that 45 governments, including the UK, will pledge urgent action and investment to protect nature and shift to more sustainable ways of farming. 
And, in a separate development, another 20 countries joined a global forum aimed at reducing deforestation from the production of commodities such as palm oil, cocoa and soya - the Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade (FACT) dialogue forum.
Matt Williams, an expert from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit think tank, said ""food and farming have largely been missing from this summit so far"" but this ""plants the seeds"" for it to make a serious contribution to reaching net-zero emissions.
Another 27 countries also signed up to a sustainable agriculture pledge to help them meet their climate goals, and will use funding earmarked for agriculture subsidies to reduce emissions.
And the UK government has announced a Â£500m programme which it said would help to protect over five million hectares of rainforests from deforestation - an area almost 20% of the size of the UK itself.
But Anna Jones at Greenpeace UK said the attempts to address the supply chains of the food industry were ""little more than a talking shop"".
She said ""there's nothing on the need to reduce demand for products like meat and dairy that are driving deforestation"".
Large-scale demonstrations are taking place in Glasgow, where the summit is being held, as well as in London and other cities in the UK and around the world.
The marches come after thousands of young activists, including Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate marched through Glasgow on Friday protesting against investment in fossil fuels and the failure to tackle the climate crisis.

293,Climate change,BBC News,Most of Oxfordshire councils' vehicles are diesel-powered,2021-11-06,"Most vehicles owned by two councils that are introducing charges for polluting vehicles are diesel-powered.
Oxfordshire County Council and Oxford City Councils' pilot scheme for a Zero Emissions Zone (ZEZ) in Oxford is set to launch in February. 
Figures obtained by the BBC show 91% of the county council's fleet and 73% of the city council's fleet is diesel-powered. 
The authorities said they were looking to introduce greener alternatives.
They said ""most vehicles"" would be charged for using a pilot area under their ZEZ, which is set to start on an unconfirmed date in February. 
Charges for the most-polluting vehicles will start at Â£10 a day and double to Â£20 in August 2025. 
The county council owns 165 vehicles, 150 of which are powered by diesel. The other 15 are electric. 
It said it now operated ""an electric-by-default"" policy when it was replacing vehicles. 
""The majority"" of its cars would be electric by 2024 and most of its vans by 2028, it said. 
Tom Hayes, Oxford City Council's cabinet member for green transport and zero carbon Oxford, said it wanted a quarter of its fleet to be electric by 2023. 
Currently, 17% of its 348 vehicles are electric. 
Mr Hayes said if the council had bought non-electric vehicles, it was because they were specialised and there was was no electric option or that choice was ""prohibitively expensive"". 
The BBC obtained the figures from the local authorities through freedom of information requests.
Of Cherwell District Council's fleet, about 89% of its 82 vehicles are diesel-powered, with the rest electric. 
A spokesman said the authority started to ""transition away"" from diesel vehicles in 2017 and had ""adopted electric vehicles wherever possible"". 
Elsewhere in the county, South Oxfordshire and Vale of White Horse District Council share two diesel vans.
They were bought in 2007 and 2008 when electric vehicles ""were not yet a technologically viable alternative"", a council spokesperson said.  
It said it would ""explore the possibility and impact"" of switching to zero-emissions vehicles in the future.  
West Oxfordshire District Council has five diesel vehicles. It was approached to comment.

But the ex-MP for Suffolk Coastal said it was a ""battle street by street"" to limit global temperature rises.
He criticised ""climate deniers"" who were failing to deliver on tackling climate change.
Lord Deben is attending COP26 as chair of the Climate Change Committee.
In an interview with BBC Politics East, Lord Deben, who was known as John Gummer when he was an MP in Suffolk between 1979 and 2010, said he saw at COP26 the leaders of major companies were ""really committed"" to the environmental agenda.
""It is a fundamental change and it is the financial world that has pushed that change because it seems to me that the people who invest have now realised that if you are going to invest with certainty you have to invest in a green future,"" he said.
Lord Deben said he was pleased councils, like Suffolk County Council, were committed to the environmental message.
He said as well as county and district councils, the government should work with parish councils.
""I think we have have to discover a new way of sharing the work because we are not going to win this battle, except if we win it street by street,"" he said.
Lord Deben said COP26 still had obstacles to overcome.
""The difficulty is that we still have some people who are really climate deniers. They pretend that they believe in it all but don't deliver,"" he said.

297,Climate change,Chris Morris & Merlyn Thomas,Climate change: The US state taking on an oil giant for greenwashing,2021-11-06,"The question of responsibility for the effects of global warming is - slowly - being tested in court. One case in Massachusetts is using consumer laws to take on oil giant ExxonMobil. If the US state wins, it will be the first case in the world to successfully prosecute a fossil fuel company for greenwashing and misleading the public.
How much is the fossil fuel industry actually doing to tackle climate change? If you listen to the companies themselves, quite a lot. ExxonMobil, the American oil and gas giant, says it's committed to new energy solutions that don't contribute as much to global warming - such as fuel made from algae. 
The firm claims it could ""one day power planes, propel ships and fuel trucks and cut their emissions in half"". One of its adverts says: ""Every technology we're working on helps lower our carbon footprint. Because when it comes to addressing climate change, our actions make a difference.""
But not everyone's buying it. ""There's this giant disconnect,"" says Naomi Oreskes, a professor at Harvard University, who's been monitoring disinformation tactics used by big businesses for years.
""The reality of their business model is to continue to exploit, develop and sell oil and gas. But their advertising, their communications, make it seem as if they're these great guys committed to sustainability and renewable energy."" 
It's what ExxonMobil's critics have described as greenwashing - pretending to be greener than you actually are. In other words, a form of alleged deception. And - partly because of that - Exxon and other oil companies are fighting various forms of legal action across the US.
The state of Massachusetts is taking on Exxon in court using consumer protection laws alleging the company continues to deceive the state's consumers and investors about the damage caused by its oil and gasoline products. Exxon strongly denies the allegations. 
The company has tried - and failed - to get the whole case dismissed on the grounds that many of the allegations made in this case fall outside the jurisdiction of Massachusetts courts, and the ads were not made in or specifically directed at residents in the state. 
But it's partly because of what climate change is doing to the people of Massachusetts that the state decided to take Exxon to court. Among other things, the lawsuit specifically mentions the threat against fishermen, and their way of life.
Bruce Silverbrand is a shell fisherman and oyster farmer who's been working on the waters around Bourne, at the gateway to Cape Cod, all his life. His days are marked by tides, winds and whether the crabs are in mating season. 
""No traffic, no bosses,"" he says, ""but I answer to Mother Nature for sure - and right now she does whatever she wants."" 
Trudging into the water day in, day out, means Bruce feels the effects of climate change every day, including the rise in water levels. 
""I get out of the boat to do a lot of my work, the water used to only come up to my waist, now it comes up to the middle of my stomach at a good tide,"" he says. ""I'm already looking at buying a bigger crane.""
He is worried - the tides have also changed and the weather is becoming more extreme. His oyster farm has now been shut for two months, costing him up to $20,000 (Â£14,555) after the remnants of Hurricane Ida dumped nine inches of rain around Bourne in early September.
It caused ""sewage and runoff to go into the bay and basically foul the water, so you can't take any shellfish out of it"", he explains. ""I've never seen so much rain ever.""
Some 21 US states are taking fossil fuel giants - including Chevron, ExxonMobil, BP and Shell - to court for alleged greenwashing and, it is claimed, engaging in a decades-long disinformation campaign about the effects of climate change. The companies deny the claims.
It's part of a pattern of legal action against fossil fuel companies, which is also happening elsewhere in the world. 
The US cases partly concern historical documents containing information on what oil companies knew and didn't reveal about climate change decades ago. Exxon says some ""cherry picked"" statements attributed to a small number of employees have been taken out of context.
But in Massachusetts and elsewhere, legal action is also focused on what fossil fuel companies are doing right now. 
""We want the company to stop engaging in misleading and deceptive practices,"" said the Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, when she first opened the case in 2019. 
The Massachusetts case could stretch on for years. Yet it is the one that has progressed furthest. And if successful, it could mean potentially the payment of billions of dollars in compensation. 
""Of course, we're seeking civil penalties, but this is really about getting the company to come clean with the public. Stop lying about what they are and what they've been doing.""
""You would think that the company's primary business is saving the world,"" says Karen Sokol, a law professor at Loyola University, New Orleans. ""The legal claim is that's a lie. Because your primary business is oil and gas. It is fossil fuels.""
Exxon has argued in court documents that no reasonable consumer watching its adverts would think it has stopped investing in fossil fuel products.
And when we asked for comment on specific examples of its advertising, the company said legal cases like the one in Massachusetts waste millions of dollars of taxpayers' money and do nothing to advance meaningful actions that reduce the risks of climate change. 
In a statement, it also said the case against it has no merit. It has accused Attorney General Healey of trying to deny Exxon its constitutional right to free speech, and of using legal means to force her ideology on the company.
Exxon says it has invested more than $10bn (Â£7.25bn) over the past 20 years in researching and developing what it describes as ""lower-emission energy solutions"". But the company's latest annual report shows it invested $10.4bn in 2020 alone in developing new, unexplored oil and gas reserves.
And that gets to the heart of the allegation - the company's adverts promoting green solutions doesn't reflect the vast majority of what Exxon actually does.
Pressure on the fossil fuel industry was on display last month in the US Congress, when - for the first time ever - leaders of the four largest oil companies in the US appeared under oath before a committee of the House of Representatives to discuss claims of climate disinformation. 
Exxon's chief executive Darren Woods was among them. He was asked by a sympathetic Republican congressman if he had ever approved a climate disinformation campaign. ""No, I have not,"" he replied.
A more hostile Democrat asked whether any company had the right to lie about climate change and then use the constitutional right to free speech as ""a shield against litigation"". ""I don't believe companies should lie,"" Mr Woods replied, ""and I would tell you we do not do that.""
But when asked whether Exxon would match the efforts of European counterparts BP and Shell to reduce oil production, he avoided answering directly, merely repeating: ""We're committed to lowering our emissions.""
The political and legal battles about climate change look set to intensify, but they aren't making much of a splash with Bruce Silverbrand back on the Massachusetts coast.
""They'll just fight it out forever. I don't think I'll ever see anything out of it,"" he says. ""I've lived my life. I'm 56 years old, and I just wonder what my children are going to be left with? If we don't all get on the same page [about climate change] and do it right now, it's already over.""

298,COP26,BBC News,COP26: How the world is reacting to the climate summit,2021-11-06,"It's the end of week one at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, and world leaders have already made some big commitments.
More than 40 countries have promised to phase out coal by 2050, and another 100 leaders have pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. 
The US and EU, meanwhile, announced that they would partner up to cut methane emissions.
BBC reporters across the globe - from Shanghai to Sao Paulo - explain how the summit and the climate pledges are going down in their countries.
Chinese social media has not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26, writes Stephen McDonell in Beijing.
The response in China's state-controlled media to the climate summit has been fairly muted. It's not that ordinary people in China don't know that the conference is taking place, but the coverage of it has definitely been downplayed.
Perhaps Xi Jinping choosing not to attend the gathering was a key factor. To report on it might draw attention to the fact that, unlike other major nations, nobody represented China at leader level.
Also, China's media is of the Communist Party and for the Communist Party. Coverage of anything involving Mr Xi, who is the General Secretary of the Party, is tightly controlled. Media outlets here would not ignore such a meeting - to which Mr Xi sent a message in lieu of an appearance - unless they had been ordered to.
Of course the conference has, at various points, been referred to. Nationalist stirrers - like those featured in the Global Times - have criticised US President Joe Biden, particularly after he singled out his Chinese counterpart for not showing up.
But Chinese social media have not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26 - it's all been fairly subdued.
Perhaps, for climate scientists wanting to build a sense of urgency and momentum out of this summit, ignoring what's happening there may be worse than attacking it.
It's all about domestic politics, writes Laura Trevelyan in New York
President Biden was determined to use COP26 to showcase American leadership on climate on the world stage - but, as MSNBC opinion columnist Hayes Brown noted, first of all, he had to apologise.
Since President Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord, that ""put us sort of behind the eight ball a little bit,' he acknowledged on the summit's first day. 
The US has a see-saw approach to global climate agreements depending on which party has the presidency. So Americans know that whatever is agreed in Glasgow could be reversed by a Republican president in 2025.
The conservative-leaning Wall St Journal pointed out that President Biden tried to paint Russia and China as ""isolated holdouts"" to a global consensus on reducing emissions but efforts by the US and its allies failed to get Moscow and Beijing to budge.
At home it's the position of Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a crucial vote when it comes to getting a $500bn climate plan through Congress, that's getting attention.
Mr Manchin is from a coal producing state, West Virginia, and when he said he had lingering concerns about the spending package, headlines declared: ""Biden's climate pledge risks being undermined by holdout senator.""
There is no sense of a climate emergency in Russia, writes Steve Rosenberg in Moscow.
Go compare. 
A British newspaper headline this week - Queen's plea to save our 'fragile' planet.
Russia's most popular (pro-Kremlin) daily - Should we really be scared of global warming?
It concluded we shouldn't, claiming there are ""positive consequences of global warming"" (especially for Russia): lower heating bills, more accessible shipping routes.
There's no sense here of a climate emergency. 
Not that the Kremlin denies there's a problem. It points out that the climate in Russia is warming 2.5 times faster than the world average. 
It sent a big delegation to Glasgow. No president, though. Vladimir Putin appeared by video screen only. 
Still, Russia promises to be carbon neutral by 2060. It signed the Glasgow declaration on forests and land use, pledging an end to deforestation by 2030.
But it wouldn't sign up to cutting methane emissions 30% by 2030. Russia is a fossil fuel superpower and wants a ""smooth"" (longer) transition to greener energy.
""Everybody wants Russia to do more to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible,"" Vasily Yablokov of Greenpeace Russia tells me. 
""I'm happy Russia now accepts climate change is happening, but I see no high ambition from our country. It looks like the Russian government's from another planet."" 
India's 2070 net zero pledge has won Narendra Modi applause in a growing nation balancing economic and environmental needs, writes Rajini Vaidyanathan in Delhi.
Although India has been a big talking point among policy makers in the weeks leading up to the COP summit, COP hasn't been such a big topic for India's masses.
But on Monday, when Prime Minister Modi announced that the country would commit to net zero by 2070, many who weren't paying much attention to goings on in Glasgow finally took note. 
Mr Modi's address was broadcast on prime time here, and while some around the world are frustrated India is signing up to meet these goals two decades later than the global 2050 target, here the pledges were seen as pragmatic in a growing country which needs to balance both economic and environmental needs. 
They were also viewed by many as a reminder that the PM won't succumb to pressure when the West has long reaped the benefits of growth while polluting. As Mr Modi reminded the summit, ""India, which is 17% of the world population, is responsible for less than 5% of emissions"" - a line that many here applauded. 
The First Post news website called the 2070 pledge a ""bold decision... without capitulating to the uncalled for bullying by the West"". And climate experts here say India's four shorter-term goals - to scale up renewables and reduce carbon emissions by 2030 - are also significant.
Australia's part in the Cop26 summit is overshadowed by politics writes Shaimaa Khalil in Sydney.
Part of Scott Morrison's job at Cop26 was to explain to the world how he was going to deliver on net zero by 2050 without phasing out coal. But the prime minister's trip to Glasgow was overshadowed by a row with French President Emmanuel Macron - and not about the climate, about submarines.  
On Sunday in Glasgow, Mr Macron accused Mr Morrison of lying to him about a $37bn deal with France which collapsed under controversial circumstances. Mr Morrison replied by saying his nation would not accept ""sledging"" or ""slurs"". 
And so this past week, rather than discussing the pressing climate debate and what Australia had achieved at COP26, most of the commentary here has been about Mr Morrison's character and whether the row will affect his standing domestically.
""Slipperiness is Scott Morrison's defining characteristic,"" wrote journalist Hugh Riminton in the Guardian. ""And it was never more on show than this week as he sold ""the Australian Way"" on climate to a sceptical crowd in Glasgow, while openly being branded a liar by France.""
Australia did make a few climate headlines in Glasgow. Along with China, Russia, India and Iran, it snubbed the international pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030, and refused to sign up to phasing out coal-fired power and stop investing in new coal plants at home and abroad.  
The verdict from Australia's ABC News? A ""terribly messy week"" for the prime minister.
The climate conference in Scotland feels a long way from the reality of most Brazilians, writes Katy Watson in SÃ£o Paulo.
Much is made of Brazil's contribution to climate change internationally because of its immense rainforest. But with all that President Jair Bolsonaro says and does - and the fact he didn't even attend COP26 - it feels a bit different over here. 
Yes, the Amazon is in the same country, but it's a long way from big cities like SÃ£o Paulo and Rio, and probably feels just as distant as a climate conference in Scotland. 
It's not that Brazilians don't care.
""People do want to participate and they have lots to contribute,"" says Silvia Cervellini, co-founder of Delibera, a Brazilian organisation helping people get involved in politics.
But since the pandemic, there's been a rise in poverty and the political and economic crisis is casting a shadow over Brazil. People have more immediate concerns. ""What we need to do is enable people to make the connection with daily life,"" Ms Cervellini says. 
And that's something that dressmaker Izildete Maria de Sousa Botelho agrees with. The 67-year-old from Minas Gerais state was selected to be part of the Global Citizen Assembly for COP.
""If we are cutting down trees, we need to rethink what we eat,"" she says. ""We outsource the responsibility to authorities and politicians and forget that it's individual actions, it's the lack of ecological awareness that we need to work on that is causing all of this.""
Many in Iran believe that it is unfair to expect the country to make any climate commitments while the sanctions remain, writes BBC Persian Service correspondent Siavash Ardalan.
Iran is among the top 10 emitters of greenhouse gases and suffers extensively from the effects of global warming. The country has seen one its worst droughts in decades this year, resulting in severe water shortages and electricity blackouts.
US sanctions and unsustainable domestic policies have only exacerbated such problems.
One member of Iran's delegation to COP26 has said that if the sanctions were lifted, ""there would be no obstacle for us to reduce our emissions"".
However, conservatives affiliated to President Ebrahim Raisi's government have put out statements that range from climate change denial to assertions COP26 is seeking to deprive Iran of its oil and gas.
Although the summit has been largely ignored by Iranian media, such critical views have made their way to some pro-government conservative outlets.
A few reform-minded newspapers have meanwhile echoed the dire warnings from UN officials and climate scientists while avoiding any critique of the government's low-key approach to COP26. 
Public opinion is divided. Many believe that it is unfair to expect any commitments from Iran while the sanctions remain in place. Others argue that climate change has only served to downplay government incompetence. 
COP26 is not front page news in Nigeria, writes Nduka Orjinmo in Abuja.
Nigeria, Africa's largest oil exporter, has promised zero emissions by 2060.
The big media houses have sent reporters to Glasgow but it is not front page news in Nigeria. 
On Wednesday, President Muhammadu Buhari said no-one in Nigeria needed ""persuading of the need for urgent action on the environment,"" pointing to desertification, floods and erosion in the country as ""enough evidence"".
But he wants access to climate finance - some of the $100bn annually available to developing economies - and foreign investment in Nigeria's gas sector to help the country wean itself off its major revenue earner, oil.
The president struck the right notes for those in Glasgow but back home people, in homes powered by gasoline generators imported from China, live in a different reality.
No-one here has experienced a stable power supply in their lifetime and if it takes burning coal to achieve that, few will reject it for the sake of the climate.
Climate activists, especially in the oil-producing Niger Delta region, have long sounded the alarm about the impact of oil drilling and gas flaring but there is little sign of any action from the government and the international oil firms.
Even as Saudi Arabia seeks to achieve net zero by 2060, the country is boosting its oil production, writes Middle East Business Correspondent Sameer Hashmi.
For a long time, the world's largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, had resisted calls from Western countries to set a definite target to reduce carbon emissions. 
Then last month, the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, announced that the country had set a goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2060. 
But, even as the Saudis seek to achieve that objective, they are boosting their oil production capacity to cater for global demand.
The country's top officials have repeatedly said tackling climate change is necessary, but that it cannot be done by ""demonising"" hydrocarbons. The energy minister believes the world needs both fossil fuels as well as renewables.
Most officials I spoke to there supported the crown prince's goal and his efforts to promote economic diversification by investing in new industries. The response by environmental activists though was more muted.","['', '1px transparent line', 'Australia', 'Brazil', 'Officials from Para State, northern Brazil, inspect a deforested area in the Amazon rain forest during surveillance in the municipality of Pacaja, 620 km from the capital Belem, on September 22, 2021', 'Iran', 'Nigeria', 'Farmer standing in oil spill area in the Niger Delta', '1px transparent line', 'Strapline - Saudi Arabia', 'More on climate summit top strapline', 'More on Climate Change bottom strapline']",2
299,COP26,BBC News,COP26: What African climate experts want you to know,2021-11-06,"Africa is the continent likely to bear the brunt of the effects of climate change even though studies show it has contributed least to the crisis.
So even though Africa has released relatively small amounts of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, those living on the continent are likely to be the victims of climate emergency disasters.
It is already suffering from extreme weather events and changes to rainfall patterns linked to climate change - leading to droughts and flooding. With a rapidly rising population, this has knock-on effects for food, poverty and gives rise to migration and conflict. 
Here five climate experts tell the BBC's Dickens Olewe the issues world leaders need to remember as they hammer out solutions to rapid climate change at COP26.
Dr Rose Mutiso, Kenyan - research director of Energy for Growth Hub:
The average African uses less electricity each year than one refrigerator consumes in the US or Europe. 
But this is going to grow - especially as temperatures rise - as Africans will have to have more energy to cool their homes and irrigate farms.
Africa too must be allowed to develop and build up its infrastructure - something that requires more energy.
So we must simultaneously have more power for rapid economic growth and quickly find alternatives to fossil fuels to provide this energy.
Yet African countries are being constrained by rich nations who make grand statements about their commitments while continuing to burn fossil fuels at home. 
Kenya already generates a far greater share of its renewable power than the US or Europe. 
While Africa welcomes partnerships, countries on the continent cannot sacrifice their ambitions. More thought needs to be given to what Africa needs in terms of industrialisation and creating jobs.
This means that richer nations need to actually reduce their own emissions and they need to live up to funding promises - in the past there have been pledges but little upfront money.
Dr Youba Sokona, Malian - vice-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change:
Climate change academics at African institutions are often not consulted by policymakers or governments on the continent.
Their research and potential solutions are shelved for too long and almost never enter into policy debates. 
This fragmented approach also effects government policies. Different ministries will often be pursuing different donor-conceived ideas - with no systematic senior political co-ordination.
This leads to piecemeal solutions.
So donors should not dictate policy but work more closely with governments on a co-ordinated approach.
This is a chance for Africa to think creatively about how to develop and address climate change at the same time. 
Prof Chukwumerije Okereke, Nigerian - climate governance and international development scholar:
Despite the large-scale and deep impact of climate change on Africa, the support countries are given to adjust is minimal.
Instead international partners focus on preventing or reducing the emission of greenhouse gases - three times more is spent on this.
The global consensus seems to be that all countries must quickly achieve a target of net zero - which means not adding to greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, so any emissions are balanced out by removing greenhouse gasses via plants or new technologies.
This neglects the massive development and energy challenges Africa faces. Put bluntly, emissions from the continent may need to rise significantly in the near term before they fall. 
Many rich countries seem to be expecting Africa to leapfrog to clean technologies for producing energy - but are not so keen to commit the scale of investment needed to make it happen, though the recent deal for South Africa to reduce its reliance on coal is a step in the right direction.
Fossil-fuel-rich African nations do need to know that the world is changing fast and create institutions and policies to drive a transition to green energy. There are great examples in Rwanda and Ethiopia. But much more needs to be done and poor governance remains a major barrier.
Dr Christopher Trisos, South African - African Climate and Development Initiative says:
Many countries in Africa already rely heavily on renewable energy - hydropower for electricity generation.
But recent droughts, such as El NiÃ±o of 2015-16, caused widespread electricity shortages. 
Research shows future climate change could reduce hydropower capacity considerably in major African river basins - and hit the agricultural sector where many people are employed.
The combination of climate change and rapid urbanisation will have devastating effects.
Limiting global warming to 1.5Â°C would massively reduce future damage to African livelihoods, health, infrastructure, economies and ecosystems - the World Bank estimates climate change could push around 40 million more Africans into extreme poverty by 2030 if not addressed.
To achieve this requires deep emission cuts, especially from high-emitting countries outside Africa. 
Yet investment to help African countries adapt to the changing weather, known as adaptation funding, is crucial.
Between 2014 and 2018 only 46% of what was committed by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries for adaptation in Africa was disbursed. 
The quality of finance also matters as most of it is provided at the moment via loans rather than grants.
This means countries that have done little to cause the climate crisis are becoming further indebted to adapt to climate change.
African policymakers also need to adopt a government-wide approach so all sectors can become more climate resilient.
Dr Kgaugelo Chiloane, South African - founder of KEC Environmental Solutions says:
Vulnerable and poor African communities need help to adapt to the inevitable impact of climate change - but their voices must also be heard.
There is a lot of traditional knowledge and expertise on the ground that is ignored.
Policies are often implemented without the involvement of local communities and their buy-in.
A bottom-up approach in Africa needs to be part of a government's overall climate change policy. 
And the ""polluter pays principle"" should be a key strategy for all governments.
Article Eight of the 2015 Paris Agreement recognises the importance of addressing the loss and damage associated with adverse effects of climate change, yet there hasn't been finance allocated for this. 
Big carbon-emitting companies should be made to take responsibility and pay for the loss and damage they have caused as big polluters given they have generated profits for decades.

301,Climate change,BBC News,Leicester schoolboy calls for climate change to be added to curriculum,2021-11-05,"A schoolboy who persuaded his teachers to add climate change to the curriculum has urged other schools to follow.
Will, 16, will represent Leicester Grammar School at COP26 in Glasgow next week when he will call on politicians to change what is taught in schools.
The sixth-form student said learning and talking more about the issue was ""a really important step"".
His teacher Marie McNally said they had already included climate change into various subjects.
At COP26 Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawai outlined plans for changes to science teaching in schools, and said a sustainability and climate change teaching strategy would be published in April 2022. 
Will, who is part of the school's Eco Club, said: ""I started by writing a letter to my school by asking how would they feel if we went on strike because I realised action was needed.
""There was teaching on climate change but it was quite limited. It was kind of a passing topic. 
""Making climate change more prevalent in the curriculum is a really important step in ensuring that it's tackled because once people understand the issue they will want to act against it because they'll realise how dangerous climate change is. 
""If action isn't taken now then the world will irreversibly change and there will be devastating impacts that will start to affect the lives of everyday people.""
Geography teacher, Mrs McNally said they had incorporated climate issues into geography in Year 7, science classes and design technology students have also discussed fast fashion and the impact it has on climate.
Talking about his COP26 visit Will said he was ""looking forward to this opportunity to make the voice of young people heard on the world stage"".
Through the school's Eco Club he and his friends have spread the climate change message as well as organised litter picks and tree planting.
Fellow member, Jed, said: ""He [Will] is a voice for our generation. I think it's important he's able to get our message across to political leaders around the world.""

302,COP26,Paul O'Hare,COP26 youth march: 'We don't have a choice',2021-11-05,"Thousands of young people are forgoing school on day six of the UN climate summit to show world leaders they expect action on the crisis.
Activist Greta Thunberg  has headlined a youth march organised by the school strike movement Fridays for Future.
Young people from across the globe joined her on the procession from Kelvingrove Park to the city centre. 
Some of them told us why.
Graham Paisley and his daughter Amy were among those gathering in Kelvingrove Park, in Glasgow's west end, ahead of the march. 
Mr Paisley, 49, said: ""I am here for Amy. I think it is really important for her to have a view of what is happening in the world. 
""Climate change is going to have a big impact on our lives and things will definitely get worse if we don't do anything about it.""
The businessman only found out about the demonstration when S4 pupil Amy, 14, mentioned it on Monday. 
They travelled from Darnley, Glasgow, to take part in what will be their first protest. 
Amy said: ""If someone is going to get something done about it then it is going to be young people as we are going to have to live with it. 
""I hope today will make governments realise that it is something people care about. 
""They need to do something about it.""
April travelled to George Square from Paisley, Renfrewshire, for the rally with her 11-month-old daughter Juneau.
The teacher said: ""It is too important not to be here as there hasn't been anything like this in the city before. 
""I worry about what the world will be like when my daughter is older. What animals will be extinct?
""Will she see the beauty of Scotland as I saw it growing up?""
Ms Hamilton, 33, hopes the outcome of COP26 will be more than just words. 
She is looking forward to seeing climate activist Greta Thunberg, whom she said is an incredible role model for her daughter. 
Ms Hamilton added: ""I think it is amazing that one person can have such an impact. She hasn't changed her tune and she hasn't let fame get to her head. 
""She is just one girl who cares about the world.""
Patrick Klein is on the march with wife Julia and son Philip. 
The software engineer is originally from Luxembourg but has lived in Glasgow for 20 years. 
Mr Klein, 50, said: ""I think it is important to make the case for climate change and to send a message to politicians that they need to take action."" 
He said he had been disappointed with what had been announced at COP26 so far as he believed it did not go far enough. 
Among the measures Mr Klein would like to see are coal consigned to history and an end to combustion engines in cars before 2030. 
Philip, 10, said: ""I came here today because I want my future to to be good and I want everyone else's future to be good.""
Glasgow University biology Professor Kathryn Elmer is attending the march with her son Keifer. 
She said: ""There has been many, many years of scepticism and talk but now is the time to make some aggressive choices. 
""We can't just sit here and watch the planet burn."" 
Prof Elmer, who is originally from Canada, wants the UK to stand up and be a global leader on climate change. 
Son Keifer, 10, said: ""Not a lot of adults are listening to young people, like Greta Thunberg.
""I think it is time for for all ages to take action.""
Evelyn Acham, a Ugandan activist with the Rise Up movement in Africa, said some young people had become ""full-time activists"" against climate change, giving up education and work due to the urgency of the crisis.
Ms Acham told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme the situation was so urgent that they had abandoned other parts of their lives to push for action.
She said: ""The young people going out there to march gives us hope. 
""The future belongs to those young people, because they still have a lot of time, they haven't achieved a lot, but the older generation have already achieved so much and (climate change) probably won't be so much their problem.
""But young people still have work to do, they still have school to do, they have a future to build, so this is our concern.""
She added: ""Many young people have given up school to become full-time activists, some have given up work, some have given up going for a masters degree, just because they're seeing the urgency of this.""
She said young people continued to take to the streets across the world because ""we do not have a choice"".
Ruth Ewan is in George Square for the rally with her daughter Peggy - who made a special sign for their pet lurcher, Dora.
The artist said: ""I want my daughter to think about what is happening to the world and to engage with the struggle for climate justice.""
Ms Ewan, 40, is also concerned about rising inequality and hopes the UN climate conference will have a positive impact across the globe. 
She added: ""I want to see more action and less blah blah blah. 
""I am excited that my daughter will get to see Greta today as she is an amazing young female role model.""
Ruby has been allowed to miss school to attend her first ever march - on her birthday.
She said: ""I wanted to come here on my birthday to help everyone's voices get heard on climate change. 
""I'm worried if I have any children they might not know what a polar bear is.""

303,Climate change,Daniel Kraemer ,Greta Thunberg: Who is the climate campaigner and what are her aims?,2021-11-05,"Environmental activist Greta Thunberg is in Glasgow, where the COP26 summit is taking place.
The 18-year-old is one of the world's best known climate campaigners.
Greta Thunberg has called the climate summit a ""failure"" and a ""PR exercise"". 
She told a youth protest in Glasgow that world leaders had had ""26 COPs, they have had decades of blah, blah, blah - and where has that got us?"".
She has also criticised goals for cutting emissions which cause global warming, saying: ""We don't just need goals for just 2030 or 2050. We, above all, need them for 2020 and every following month and year to come.""
However, Thunberg has avoided getting into the detail of what action should be taken, saying ""it is nothing to do with me"". 
This video can not be played
Thunberg became well-known after she protested outside the Swedish parliament in 2018, when she was 15.
She held a sign saying ""School Strike for Climate"", to pressure the government to meet carbon emissions targets.
Her small campaign had a global effect, inspiring thousands of young people across the world to organise their own strikes. 
By December 2018, more than 20,000 students - from the UK to Japan - had joined her by skipping school to protest.
A year later, she received the first of three Nobel Peace Prize nominations for climate activism.
In 2019, Thunberg sailed across the Atlantic on a yacht to attend a UN climate conference in New York.
Delivering what is probably her most famous speech, she angrily told world leaders they were not doing enough.
""You all come to us young people for hope. How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,"" she said.
Thunberg was named Time Magazine's Person of the Year in December 2019.
Thunberg has received support from climate activists, scientists and public figures.
Broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough told her she has achieved things many others have failed to do, adding: ""You have aroused the world. I'm very grateful to you.""
Prince Harry praised Thunberg's campaigning, saying ""every country, every community, every school, every friendship group, every family needs their own Greta"".
Alok Sharma, the president of the COP26 summit, has said that Thunberg's UN speech in 2019 had made him feel ""really uncomfortable"" because it held up a ""mirror"" to his generation.
But not all politicians have been as complimentary. 
Donald Trump tweeted that she should ""work on her anger management problem"" while Russian President Vladimir Putin described her as a ""kind but poorly informed teenager"".
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.
Thunberg has Asperger syndrome, a developmental disorder, and has described it as a gift. She said being different can be a ""superpower"".
Thunberg's mother, Malena Ernman, is an opera singer and former Eurovision Song Contest participant. 
Her father Svante Thunberg, is an actor and a descendant of the scientist who created a model of the greenhouse effect.

304,COP26,BBC News,My Day at COP26: 'By helping out delegates I'm remembering granddad',2021-11-05,"Harjot Singh Kambo is one of an army of volunteers helping COP26 visitors find their way around. In the latest of a series of first-person accounts from the summit, he explains why the task is a very personal one for him.
I'm one of 1,000 COP26 volunteers scattered around Glasgow and Edinburgh. Today I did the morning shift from 07:30 to 10:30, standing at Buchanan Bus Station to welcome delegates from around the world.
They're coming from the train station or from their hotels, and we're getting them on the electric shuttle buses to the summit, making sure they're on time for their meetings.

What's in it for us volunteers? Well, it's a small way of helping to raise awareness about saving the planet. Plus, I know the city well.
My grandparents came to Glasgow from the Punjab in India during the 1950s. After they arrived my grandfather worked on the buses and trams. He saved up enough money, got a flat in the west end of Glasgow, opened his own shop and raised a family.
My parents met in Glasgow and I was born and brought up here. I went to University of Strathclyde in the city - I graduated last year with a degree in biomedical engineering.
So it feels good to give something back to Glasgow. I took some time off from my job at a life sciences company to volunteer.
I've been talking to the bus drivers, just having a bit of banter. I'm sure my granddad would have done the same many years ago. It's bringing back memories of him because he just passed away last year.
Some of the delegates like to stop and have a wee chat about what they're here for, too. Especially the indigenous people from the US and Canada. You really get a sense of why COP26 is so important to them - as far as they're concerned they're representing their background, their family heritage here.
My Day at COP26:
During my first week, I met a lot of people from the Pacific Islands, the Caribbean and Africa. You're trying to guess from their accents where everyone's come from.
You see all these ministers and government officials - I was quite intimidated by them at first. But today one of them gave me a wee fist-bump to show his appreciation. I think he was from Kyrgyzstan. That left me confounded for the next five minutes, in a good way.
There was a lady from Zambia. She was a bit flustered, it was dark and cold. And she didn't know where to go. So we took her indoors to get her some warmth, shared a wi-fi hotspot with her, she opened up Google Maps and we pointed her in the right direction.
It might be cold outside right now but we Glaswegians are warm inside. 
As told to Jon Kelly
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

An extension of the 2015 Paris Agreement to include the Crown Dependencies was announced at COP26.
The island will now have to meet the obligations of the treaty, including cutting carbon emissions to net zero.
Daphne Caine MHK said the agreement was ""hugely significant"". 
Representing the Manx government at the conference, she said the had brought ""nearly 200 countries together"" to take ""urgent action"" needed on climate change.    
A government spokesman said the extension came after ""lengthy negotiations"" between the Isle of Man, Jersey, and Guernsey, and UK authorities.
That included a ""full review"" of the Manx government's plan to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, he added.
The extension was announced by Greg Hands MP, the UK Minister of State for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS), at COP26 on Thursday, 
His department said once the move had been formally accepted, it would ""bring the Crown Dependencies into scope of the UK's Nationally Determined Contribution target to reduce emissions by at least 68% by 2030 on 1990 levels.""

308,COP26,Becky Morton & Malu Cursino,COP26: Duke of Edinburgh-style climate award to launch,2021-11-05,"Pupils will be recognised for their efforts to protect the environment in a new Duke of Edinburgh-style award. 
It is one of a series of measures aimed at putting climate change at the heart of education. 
The plans are being set out by Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. 
Staff will also be supported to teach children about nature and their impact on the world through a ""model science curriculum"", to be in place by 2023.
Climate change is already taught in science and geography lessons in England as part of the curriculum.
Mr Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the model science curriculum would ""support and enrich"" the teaching of climate change for primary school pupils.
The education secretary - who is also the climate change minister for his department - said the ""education and empowerment of youth"" was important and education ministers from other countries are coming together at COP26 on Friday to learn from each other. 
The Climate Leaders award will help children to develop their skills and knowledge in biodiversity and sustainability, with their work recognised at an annual national awards ceremony. 
Pupils will be able to progress through different levels of the award - bronze, silver and gold - in a similar way to the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, which includes volunteering and extracurricular activities. 
The education secretary will also confirm plans to pilot ""energy pods"" that can replace gas and coal boilers to supply a school's heating and hot water without carbon emissions. 
The pods are being tested in some schools first and could be rolled out more widely to other public-sector buildings if successful. 
Mr Zahawi said that all new schools being built in the country, including 50 this year, would have ""net zero in operation"".
Schools, colleges and nurseries are also being encouraged to improve the biodiversity of their grounds.
And from next month, all further education teachers trained via an apprenticeship will be required to integrate sustainability into their teaching. 
The measures are form a draft sustainability and climate change strategy. These measures will be built on over the next six months - in collaboration with young people, teachers, sustainability experts and environmentalists - before a final strategy is published in April 2022. 
The education secretary will host a panel session on the sixth day of the COP26 conference, which is focused on youth and public empowerment, with education ministers from around the world. 
Mr Zahawi said ""education is one of our key weapons in the fight against climate change"". 
""Empowering teachers in every school to deliver world-leading climate change education will not only raise awareness and understanding of the problem, but also equips young people with the skills and knowledge to build a sustainable future,"" he added.
James Bowen, director of policy for school leaders' union NAHT, said there was a ""huge amount of good work already taking place in schools to reduce their carbon footprint"" - but ""a coherent national strategy is essential if we are to see real impact"". 
""The government must be truly ambitious, not just looking to new buildings, but also at how the existing school estate can be made as environmentally-friendly as possible,"" he said. 
He added that any work on a new model curriculum must be developed ""in close consultation with the profession"". 
Meanwhile thousands of young people are taking part in a climate protest in Glasgow organised by Fridays for Future Scotland, a group inspired by the activism of Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg - who is taking part in the demonstration.
One of those taking part is Finlay Pringle, 14, from Ullapool in the Highlands. He said young people ""shouldn't think twice"" about protesting in support of the things they care about.
The education secretary urged pupils not to miss lessons, telling Times Radio he hoped young people would protest ""on a Saturday and a Sunday, not in school time"". 
No 10 added that young people missing school to attend climate demonstrations was ""extremely disruptive at a time when the pandemic has already had a huge impact on their learning"".
Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said schools were already working ""very hard on tackling climate change"" but ""children and young people rightly want to see far more concerted action from policy-makers"".

309,COP26,Aled Scourfield,COP26: Newgale road could be destroyed in 15 years,2021-11-05,"Erosion could destroy parts of an important coastal road by 2036 with no guarantee a replacement will be built.
The A487, which runs along Wales' west coast, is a vital link road for people travelling between Haverfordwest and the St Davids peninsula. 
In 2014 experts said the shingle bank at Newgale was unstable, and would lead to the destruction of the road.
Plans were drawn up for a replacement, but a freeze on new road projects in Wales has put that in doubt.
Pembrokeshire council's cabinet member for environment Cris Tomos called for swift action and said it was vital the Welsh government committed to the scheme.
""From our calculations, this shingle bank has around 15 years left. It is imperative that we work quickly to move along with this plan,"" he said. 
""This link is crucial as an economic highway to bring visitors and goods to the area.""
He believes if climate change takes a quicker pace than anticipated it could be ""the first road"" to be affected.
Plans have been drawn up to build a new road link, and a preferred route was chosen in 2018.
It would stretch from the existing road at Penycwm, across the valley to a new roundabout near Roch, some distance from the coast.
Pembrokeshire council hoped it would be completed by 2025.
The local authority estimates it would cost Â£19m and it needs finance from the Welsh government. 
However, in June, deputy climate change minister Lee Waters announced a freeze on all new road projects, pending a review which is not due to be completed until summer 2022.
The Welsh government has provided more than Â£400,000 for the scheme to date, but is yet to commit to building a new route. 
Josh Phillips, chair of Solva community council, said the plans had been earmarked for five years without any tangible work taking place.
""It's vital for public services such as ambulances and the fire services, and providing access to tourism. It's vital. We need action sooner rather than later,"" he said.
""This is Wales-wide and we need to start looking for the solutions for all our towns and communities along the Welsh coast that will be affected by climate change.""
The Welsh government said: ""We have provided funding for the Newgale coastal adaptation plan and A487 route diversion over the last few years. 
""A roads review panel has been set up to look at whether new roads are the right solutions for transport problems, in line with Llwybr Newydd, the Wales Transport Strategy. 
""The panel is expected to produce a full report on current and planned road schemes next summer.""

312,COP26,glas Fraser,Blah Blah Blether in the Blue Zone,2021-11-05,"When Glaswegians blether about a blue zone and a green zone, they're probably talking about football. But for two weeks, this is not about Rangers-Celtic rivalry but about climate change.
A short stone's throw westwards from BBC Scotland headquarters to the Science Centre, the green zone is open to the public for exhibits and discussions on what is to be done. 
A longer stone's throw in a northerly direction would land in United Nations territory. It would be unwise to lob stones, however, as the security is fierce, the fences are high, and vessels patrol the Clyde with military menace to those who wish to disrupt the Cop26 summit.
I went through the queues and airport-style security, entering this small blue strip of Clydeside that is non-Scottish for a fortnight. 
And I can report that it's a fascinating gathering of humanity - every country and race represented, numerous languages spoken, and 28 currencies so far exchanged in the NatWest branch. (Most delegates and observers arrive with US dollars or euros, the manager tells me.)
The summitry was at its highest peak on Monday and Tuesday, when the heads of government were whisked in, made their three-minute speeches, and were whisked out. Their Excellencies' departure left negotiating teams for 10, or 11, or maybe 12 days to grind through the voluminous detail of what each country is offering if they are to fulfil the pledges and meet the targets set six years ago in Paris. 
That process is mostly done in private and in numerous meeting rooms around the Scottish Events Campus. The public face of it is in plenary sessions in two vast marquees, named after two of the higher peaks in Britain - Cairn Gorm and Pen y Fan. They're summits. Get it?
Seats are set out with social distancing in mind for each UN member state. Delegates for each country tend to travel in packs, bristling with self-importance, their imminent arrival at plenary sessions signalled in advance by vibrations in the temporary floor.
Many more seats, further back, are for representative groups of civil society, and of the many offshoots of the UN. The deals may be cut by the big players, but the seating plan is designed to signal that this is inclusive.
And that's where the rest of Cop26 comes in. Blue zone passes are prized, and hard to secure, but this is an event intended to welcome in the world for a gigantic gabfest about climate change. 
It feels busy, with people milling and jostling along the long corridor spine of the campus, Where it widens, there are work stations and chairs set out to encourage conversation or to offer a rest. Anywhere, you can find people squatting by a wall, checking social media or earnestly engaged in Zoom calls to who-knows-where. 
The Hydro, designed for very large concerts, has been turned into an 'Action Zone', with 'Action Hubs'. Slogans exhort attendees: 'Race to Zero', and 'We can do this if we act NOW'.  Some simply reduce that to the slogan 'NOW'. 
A giant and beautiful globe, perhaps 10 metres wide and featuring the world's weather systems in perpetual daylight, hangs from the roof and spins slowly.
'Action', in hubs and zones, turns out to be entirely about talking. And talking. And talking more. 
In small groups, around tables, to audiences and down the barrel of lenses. Around TV cameras, technicians wait wearily and presenters check their studio-quality hair.
Far more activity is through streaming links to the worldwide web of climate change activists. Numerous bloggers and vloggers are in selfie mode, transmitting their efforts and insights back to their supporter bases in distant lands.
This is the NGOcracy: non-government organisations which are drawn into the conversations between nations. While activists seek protest and grandstand outside the perimeter fence, and rail against the 'blah blah blah' of the government representatives inside, the uncomfortable truth for them is that their people are literally inside the tent.
In a vast hall of two-storey pavilions, the Peatland Pavilion is next to Ghana's and the Indigenous People's Forum. The Climate Vulnerable Forum is next to Korea, Scotland and Turkey, and not far from WWF pressure group. Compassion in World Farming adjoins five central Asian republics.
There is a water pavilion, near one for the cryosphere (the earth's receding icy bits). Poorer countries offer little more than flags, leaflets and reproach for promises unmet, while Qatar and the UAE flare and flash their oil and gas wealth for all to see.
Europeans, who seem to dominate the crowds and discussions, play down their state of global privilege, with pavilions designed for, well, more talking. France goes for a minimalist, stripped down wooden stockade. Germany has little more than a TV studio. 
The UK is branded with capitals 'GREAT Britain'. Having the presidency, it gets the best location - next to the vast United Nations pavilion.
Throughout the day, each pavilion has a programme of speaker events. But quietly. To avoid clashing speeches in neighbouring pavilions, audiences listen through headphones. 
This is also because so much of the discussion is being streamed online, and some contributors beamed in from far away. In the Armadillo concert venue, its 3,000 seats are cordoned off with yellow tape, and its wide stage set out only for the cameras.
The summit has its own 'side events', with titles that demonstrate how a complex organisation can squeeze the life out of language: ""Informal consultations on matters relating to the forum on the impacts of response measure"", and another on ""'the second periodic review of the long-term global goal"".
There is a more digestible prospect from ProVeg Deutschland: 'It's time to address the cow in the room: we want diet change'.
There is business too. Lots of business. Its pavilion is next to a small section for a group drawing attention to the plight of the Congolese forest. But its presence is much more pervasive.
Primary sponsors and supporters of the United Nations organisers include Microsoft, NatWest, Scottish Power, SSE, Sainsbury's, Sky and Unilever. On display, there is a hydrogen powered double-decker bus made by Alexander Dennis in Falkirk, and an all-electric Jaguar. The brand with the best product placement, however, is Dettol. The masks and constant cleaning remind you this is a gathering with big infection risks.
In numerous meeting rooms throughout the campus, they're talking deals. Billions and billions of dollars, euros and pounds are in search of green projects, and finding quality ones can be hard to pin down. 
By happy coincidence, many of the 'observers' have projects to promote - including city and regional governments, power companies, transport and data innovators. They are in search of those billions. 
So Cop26 is at least three-fold; the ultimate government summit on co-ordinating a response to the world's biggest challenge: it's a gathering for the global environmental movement: and it's a trade fair for businesses and banks that are plugging into its potential for making profit as well as doing good. 
What gives it added energy is the expectation that this Glasgow Cop must set the pace for the decisive decade, and that this is the first time such a gathering has been possible since the pandemic struck. As a representative sample of the world's people, you can sense the relief at being able to meet up, and be social animals. 
There's less pleasure taken in the amount of queuing.  To get in, snaking queues leading to airport-style security last up to an hour at their morning peak. They feature highly unBritish queue-jumping.
Once inside, the only sign of being on UN territory is that British police are gone, and replaced by brown, American-style security uniforms. 
And the only sign of being in an enclave of Scotland is the food, for which more queues are a feature. 
In seeking to reduce food miles, the UN doesn't do world cuisine. A huge black-draped eating hall is dominated by a sign simply saying 'Fish and Chips'.  This is Peterhead-landed, says the menu, and for Â£8, you have also to account for 1.1kg of carbon dioxide.
'Grab and Go' stalls are a further showcase for Scottish fare; vegetarian broth at 0.1kg of CO2 or a venison roll at 0.7kg.
Do the delegates and observers in this Conference of Parties 26 appreciate the local food? They don't have much choice. Like any other, this environmental army marches on its stomach. 
Only one staple of the Scottish diet is left when everything else is consumed - shelf upon shelf of Irn Bru.

As well as youngsters explaining how climate change is affecting them, UK government Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi will set out a series of measures aimed at further embedding climate change in the English schools curriculum. The plans include a Climate Leaders award recognising efforts to protect the environment.
Away from the summit campus, thousands of young people are expected to join a march through the city organised by campaigner Greta Thunberg's Fridays for Future movement.

There's been a lot of talk about cutting carbon emissions this week. But only two months ago, UN analysts reported we're actually on course to increase them. Scientists say to avoid the worst impacts of hotter conditions, our emissions must drop by 45% by 2030. The report, analysing the climate policies of more than 100 countries before the summit, said they would increase by 16% during that period. That could, it projected, cause a rise of 2.7C (4.9F) above pre-industrial times - far above the 2C pledged by the international community.

314,COP26,Stephanie Hegarty,COP26: Emissions of rich put climate goals at risk - study,2021-11-05,"The carbon footprint of the world's richest 1% is on track to be 30 times higher than what's needed to limit global warming to 1.5C, a study says.
But emissions of the poorest 50% will continue to be below climate goals. 
The research, carried out by two European environmental agencies, comes as world leaders meet at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.
""A tiny elite appear to have a free pass to pollute,"" says Naftoke Dabi at Oxfam.
The charity commissioned the study from the Stockholm Environment Institute and the Institute for European Environmental Policy. 
""Their over-sized emissions are fuelling extreme weather around the world and jeopardising the international goal of limiting global heating.""
Climate scientists warn that there is a finite amount of greenhouse gases that we can continue to release into the atmosphere before the planet warms to more than 1.5C from pre-industrial levels. By 2030, they say, we need to only emit as much carbon dioxide as the planet can absorb.
If this amount were split evenly and every adult on the planet had a share, by 2030 we could each emit 2.3 tonnes of CO2 every year.
The super-rich - many of whom have multiple homes, private jets and superyachts - emit a lot more than others. A recent study that tracked the air travel of celebrities via their social media accounts found some emitted over a thousand tonnes a year. 
But the global 1% are not just billionaires, or even millionaires - it includes anyone earning over $172,000. 
This study also looked at the world's richest 10% - anyone earning over $55,000 - and found emissions were still high. The richest 10% will emit nine times more carbon dioxide than their share.
One example of people in the top 10% is the Curths, a family of four in the suburbs of Toledo, Ohio. Traci Curth, her husband and her teenage daughter each drive a car. 
""The suburb I live in, that's pretty much how everyone gets around,"" says Traci.
Toledo has hot summers and cold winters, so the air-conditioning is on when the heating isn't. The family has a freezer loaded with chicken breasts and mince beef - they eat meat about four or five times a week.
""I would say that's pretty normal for most American families,"" says Traci.
For English teacher Togonin Severin Togo in Kati, Mali, life is quite different. 
Like 80% of people in the world he doesn't have a car - he travels to work on his moped. 
""Cars are considered to be for rich people,"" he says.  
He gave up meat recently, but before that he ate it just two or three times a week. And - like 90% of people around the world - he's never been on an aeroplane. 
But he does worry about emissions from people burning waste in his city, where the waste management system is not functional, as well as the inefficient wood and gas burners used for cooking.
Oxfam's report found that it's the 40% in the middle doing the most to curb emissions. 
While their carbon footprint rose significantly between 1990 and 2015, it is set to drop, thanks to changes being made at government level in sectors like transport and energy since the Paris climate agreement in 2015. 
But governments need to do more, Oxfam's Naftoke Dabi says, calling for bans and taxes on ""carbon-intensive luxury goods, such as mega-mansions, SUVs or space tourism"".
""They need to tackle the emissions of the richest because they're hugely responsible for the climate crisis, and it's the poorest that are paying the highest price,"" she says.

315,Climate change,Chris McLaughlin,I play for the greenest football club in the world,2021-11-05,"In the picturesque Cotswolds, a footballer from Bellshill in Lanarkshire is plying his trade with a club recognised by the United Nations as the greenest in the world.
A strange mix, but one that's working for both parties in more ways than one.
A burning passion for sporting sustainability wasn't the reason for Nicky Cadden making the switch last year from Greenock Morton, in the Scottish Championship, to Forest Green Rovers in English League Two - but it's a way of life he is now embracing.
""It has made me think about what I'm eating and what I'm putting into my body - I'm not a full on vegan but I'm definitely eating more tofu as a substitute for meat,"" the 25-year-old winger says.
""To be honest, I'm not sure I could live without cheese and milk.""
His new club is fully vegan, though - everything from the half-time pies, to the players pre-match meals is completely plant based - no exceptions.
""I've actually done a lot more research about it since I've been down here,"" Cadden says. 
""I never thought climate change was such a big deal until I started looking into it - it's massive.
""We've only got one planet if we don't look after it, then what?"" says the former Livingston and Airdrie player.
Forest Green is a football club where net zero is every bit as important as netting goals.
Power for the club's stadium comes from a solar panels stretched across the roof of the stands; the team's strips are made from bamboo; the pitch is completely organic; electric power points for cars can be found around the stadium - even the electronic advertisement boards are powered by wind.
It's the first, Fifa recognised, carbon neutral club in the world and with that, comes global media attention, especially in the weeks before COP26.
In the past few weeks alone, camera crews have arrived to tell the Forest Green story from Germany, Mexico and the USA.
""It's turning people's heads and making a name for the club,"" said Cadden.
""Hopefully we can progress up the leagues and take the message with us.""
Even if they progress no further, Forest Green are already the footballing benchmark when it comes to sustainability.
Owner, and former new age traveller, Dale Vince speaks regularly to clubs from across the world who call to ask what they can learn.
With Fifa and the English Premier League now committed to carbon neutrality by 2040, his phone is going to be very busy.
""It's been going on for a long time, to be fair,"" he says.
""It's just that the level of interest has been increasing every year. 
""The idea is to engage the entire world of sport and through them, reach the entire world of sports fans, billions of people, and engage them in the fight against the climate crisis.""
Sport's global carbon footprint is understood to be roughly the same size as countries such as Poland or Spain - not insignificant but experts say sport's secret weapon in the climate change battle is its ability to raise awareness.
""What sport can do is transform the public conversation about carbon zero politics,"" said David Goldblatt, who is the chairman of Football for the Future.
""Sport reaches a demography and numbers of people that no other popular cultural phenomena reaches.
""In a world where cynicism towards politicians and scientists is rife, sport retains a kind of strange authenticity.""
Cadden's climate change journey may well have been an accidental one but he's also enjoying his football at a club that has captured the attention of their opponents as well as the wider world.
Being heard on climate change is easier when you sit top of your league and can show that football and sustainability can happily exist together. 
""It's been a big change for me, being the first time I've moved away from the family, but I've settled in really well and I'm loving my football here,"" said Cadden.
""Everyone knows how huge football is in this country and if I can do my bit to play well and raise awareness at the same time, then I'm happy.""

316,Climate change,James Cook,The twin threats of flooding and drought,2021-11-05,"Lorraine Watson's chip shop has been badly flooded five times in 10 years.
The Carron fish bar in Stonehaven takes its name from the river which flows beside - and all too often through - its basement.
The last time that happened was in the early hours of 12 August 2020 when the spate lifted freezers from the floor and left behind a sticky, stinking soup of mud and grease.
The bill ran to Â£8,000, according to Ms Watson, who says the floods have become more intense and more frequent in her decade running the shop.
On the same summer's day, a train hit a landslide at Carmont just outside the town, killing the driver, a conductor and a passenger. 
Is climate change a factor in Aberdeenshire's repeated, devastating floods? 
""One hundred per cent"" declares Ms Watson, adding: ""We must take action. Everybody must take action.""
In fact Stonehaven, nestled beside a natural harbour on the North Sea, some 15 miles (24km) south of Europe's carbon capital, Aberdeen, faces not just one type of flooding but three, all potentially linked to climate change. 
First there is the River Carron's propensity to fill with water running off the surrounding hills and then to burst its banks.
Secondly, even if the river does not overflow there is the threat of street flooding when downpours overwhelm the drains.
Thirdly, as a coastal community there are concerns about high tides, storm surges and the longer-term risk of rising sea levels. 
To militate against the first threat - river flooding - Aberdeenshire Council is building defences which include raising bridges, re-routing the river, and building a hi-tech hydraulic wall which will slice through the middle of the town and should automatically rise even higher during the most severe floods.
The scheme has divided residents, partly on aesthetic grounds. It is also running late and it is costly, although exactly how costly the council refuses to disclose for what it says are contractual reasons.
Nonetheless principal engineer Rachel Kennedy insists it will protect 820 people in 372 homes, along with a school, a police station and public utilities. 
She agrees with Ms Watson that the floods here are growing in intensity and frequency because of climate change, citing a projection that by 2080 a third more water will be flowing down the Carron. 
Although Ms Kennedy has raised the height of the flood wall to take that into account, she cautions that you cannot build your way out of climate change and stresses that the project is not a ""silver bullet"".
""This only protects from river flooding, it won't solve every problem,"" she warns.
And there are so many problems. Next year the UK government must by law publish the third in a series of five-yearly reports assessing climate change risks.
A summary of the situation in Scotland which has already been prepared for that report concludes that flooding is one of the most severe risks facing the country, posing a serious threat to infrastructure and representing ""the costliest hazard to businesses."" 
By the 2050s, the experts predict, Scotland's temperatures will have risen by 1.1 degrees Celsius, while winter rainfall will have increased by about 7% in amount and as much as 25% in intensity, all compared to the period 1981 - 2000.
Summer rain storms are forecast to become rarer but heavier with a risk of flash floods but at the same time the nation may be grappling with the opposite problem - water scarcity as a result of a 7% drop in overall summer rainfall.
Stonehaven and Wick have much in common. Both are small east coast towns with a history of herring fishing and flooding.
This summer though the Caithness town's issue was not too much rain but too little, a problem felt particularly acutely at the local distillery, the home of Old Pulteney single malt, when its water source - Loch Hempriggs - dropped dangerously low.
You can't make whisky without water and in August, with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) issuing warnings about ""significant scarcity"" in Caithness, owners Inver House Distillers announced a suspension in production.
It was not a difficult call says distillery manager Malcolm Waring.
""We want to protect the environment,"" he says. 
""We want to protect our source. If we don't have that, we can't make whisky here. So the decision was an easy one to stop, let it recover, let it sustain itself.""
The supply has since recovered, water is now pouring into the distillery again and Mr Waring is optimistic that the source can be managed sustainably although as the world warms the risk of another shortage is unlikely to recede.
According to Sepa this summer was Northern Scotland's fourth driest since records began in 1862.
Some public water supplies ran short, particularly in the far north and the south west, while more than 100 private water supplies struggled with scarcity, notably in South Ayrshire where 67 properties were affected for almost five months.
It was Scotland's second drought in just three years - in 2018 a dry winter combined with a lack of summer rainfall and record high temperatures led to restrictions on water use, wildfires and the death of many fish. 
Not only was there a shortage during 2018 but the drought actually drove up demand for water by 30%, according to Sarah Halliday who lectures in geography and environmental science at Dundee University.
""If it's very dry, farmers have to irrigate their crops,"" she says. ""We all want to water our gardens, so we start using our hosepipes much more often.""
Dr Halliday acknowledges that for many people in Scotland their personal experience of climate change so far is enjoying hotter summers - ""everybody's got their paddling pool filled up,"" she says - but she thinks we must stop taking our water supply for granted.
To tackle both floods and droughts she recommends reducing the use of artificial grass and concrete; turning off the tap while brushing teeth; and limiting hosepipe use.
""Actually producing drinkable water that comes through our tap is a hugely costly process that also requires a lot of carbon emissions,"" Dr Halliday says.
""And the fact that we quite often stick a hose on that tap and pump it into the garden, it's a huge waste of energy and materials.""
Public agencies are echoing some of that advice. 
Scottish Water estimates that the nation's water usage amounts to 165 litres per person daily, with treating it and heating it accounting for 6% of carbon emissions, the same as the aviation industry. 
Along with Sepa, which last year published Scotland's first ever National Water Scarcity Plan, it is urging people to conserve what is a vital resource.  
At the same time the environment agency is about to undertake what it calls a ""wholesale update"" of its flood risk mapping incorporating up-to-date climate change data. 
In the latest landmark UN report on the climate, water is mentioned more than 3,000 times.
For Lorraine Watson in the Stonehaven chip shop, that is understandable.
""Climate change for us is immense,"" she says.
""It isn't going away.""

317,COP26,Katie Silver,"Inflation: Global food prices hit fresh 10-year high, UN says",2021-11-05,"Global food prices have hit the highest level in over a decade after rising by more than 30% in the last year, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says.
The agency's figures highlighted the soaring cost of cereals and vegetable oils around the world.
Vegetable oil prices hit a record high after rising by almost 10% in October.
Disruptions to supplies, high commodity prices, factory closures and political tensions are helping to push up prices.
The FAO said its measure of cereal prices was up by more than 22% compared to a year earlier.
The price of wheat was one of the major contributors to this rise, up almost 40% in the last 12 months after major exporters - such as Canada, Russia and the US - had poor harvests. 
""In the case of cereals, we're facing a situation where one could say it's climate change which is ultimately causing falling production,"" Peter Batt, an agribusiness expert at Curtin Business School told the BBC.
""We've had pretty bad years [of harvests] in a lot of places."" 
The FAO said its index of vegetable oil prices was pushed up by rises in the cost of palm, soy, sunflower and rapeseed oils. 
In the case of palm oil, prices have been driven higher after output from Malaysia was ""subdued"" due to ongoing shortages of migrant workers, the FAO said.
Labour shortages are helping to push up the cost of production and transportation of food in other parts of the world too.
Mr Batt said: ""The other problem that has emerged is getting the product out. For example, here in Australia we've had a lot of ships arrive to take the food away but we can't get crew to come in because of Covid.""
Shipping disruptions are also pushing up milk prices, with the cost of dairy products rising by almost 16% over the last year.
Brigit Busicchia from Macquarie University said speculation on global markets is also contributing to price volatility: ""Since the 1990s, the deregulation of commodity futures trading has made it possible for institutional investors to enter this market on a large scale.""
This is having a particular impact on countries which rely on food imports.
""Expect countries like Egypt or other Middle Eastern countries to experience tensions in their provisioning of cereals,"" she said.
Ms Busicchia also highlighted that rising food prices are typically felt most acutely by the poor, as disadvantaged groups are pushed further into poverty and that this has the potential to heighten social and political tensions.

318,COP26,Helen Briggs,Wishcycling: The dos and don'ts of being good at recycling,2021-11-05,"Ever paused with your hand over the recycling bin, wondering whether to drop in that cheese-splattered pizza box? You could be a wishcycler - keen to recycle more stuff and do your bit for the planet, but confused about the best way to go about it. 
Wishcycling, or aspirational recycling, describes the well-intentioned, but often unfounded belief, that something is recyclable, even though it's not. We've followed five items that cause recycling confusion on their journey through a recycling plant to help you think before you throw.
From a metal gantry high above the factory floor I watch bits of cardboard, shards of billowing plastic and other ephemera hurtle down a conveyor belt. The whirr and clank of machinery fills the air, and there's a slight whiff of garbage as a truck disgorges a steady stream of recycling on the floor. 
A forklift truck piles everything on the belt, ready for sorting. Covering an area of 20,000 square metres - nearly four football fields - this site in central London handles 120,000 tonnes of recycling a year, or roughly 25 tonnes per hour.
""What we'd like to convey to people is that recycling does work - there are a hundred facilities like this one across the UK,"" says Tim Duret, director of sustainability technology at Veolia UK, which runs this plant in Southwark. ""The objective is to sort the mixed waste into different fractions - the glass, the plastics, the metals and the fibre [paper and cardboard]. And we understand that it is not always simple to know what can and what can't be recycled.""
You can say that again. Turn over a food packet and you'll find a mindboggling array of recycling symbols. And while the packaging might say something is recyclable, that doesn't mean your council will accept it. One council's recycling is another council's general waste, so it's important to always check your local rules.
Here in London, hand pickers wearing gloves and masks are the first line of defence against the wishcyclers. Their hands shoot out with lightning speed to snatch things from the conveyor belt that shouldn't be there, from plastic bags and bits of polythene, to what looks like a plastic hose. 
Plastic causes particular confusion, with the likes of carrier bags, frozen food bags, bread food bags, crisp packets and pet food pouches often ending up in the recycling bin by mistake. ""That is by far and away the largest amount of stuff that isn't targeted by the local authority, so comes into your wishcycling bracket,"" says Helen Bird, recycling expert at the waste reduction charity, Wrap.
She says some supermarkets are starting to collect crisp packets, plastic bags and other food wrapping in an effort to build new markets for products made from other types of plastics, from refuse sacks to toilet brushes.
I'm not sure if my plastic conditioner bottle can be recycled and, as it turns out, I'm not alone. According to Wrap, more than half of households put items in general waste that could be recycled, including shampoo and conditioner bottles, cleaning and bleach bottles, foil and aerosols. ""If it's plastic and bottle-shaped it can go in [the recycling],"" says Helen.
My ready meal container presents another dilemma. Tim says the plastic tub is accepted here, but that's not the case everywhere. The plastic film can't be recycled, though. It must be peeled off and put in with the general rubbish. As for any lingering lentils and mash - ""3D"" food, as he puts it, should be scraped off and emptied out.
My coffee cup is a firm reject. Though made from a type of fibre - cellulose - the cup has a thin plastic lining, which rules it out. And the plastic lid can't be recycled either; instead the whole caboodle should be taken to coffee shops or other outlets, such as railway stations, which run take-back schemes. If kept separated from other materials, coffee cups can be recycled.
Thankfully, my pizza box, while greasy, isn't so messy it fails the test. Tim drops it on the conveyor belt, where I watch it leap down the line to join other cardboard boxes. My shopping receipt can go in too. I was worried it was made of the wrong kind of paper - some are printed on shiny paper that can't be recycled in many places. It's another item that causes confusion. I'm told mine is fine.
Relieved some of my things have passed muster, I'm shown some of the more extreme items rejected by the hand pickers. There are frying pans, bits of a microwave, parts of a television. And textiles such as jeans and tights, which can get tangled up in the machinery causing the whole production line to grind to a halt. 
When we stare down at the optical sorters - a series of spinning discs that sort things by size and shape - we notice a long pink ribbon has wrapped itself around part of the sorting apparatus like a snake. ""There are people who will put any old rubbish in the recycling,"" Helen says. 
""Things like nappies, sanitary products, dog poo, dead animals, syringes. The belt will be stopped - physically somebody has to go through that stuff and pull it out. Fortunately, they are really in the minority.""
As we walk along the gantry, different streams of glass, plastics, metals and paper are emerging and chugging off in different directions as the machines sort stuff by size, shape, colour and structure, using lights and lasers, magnets and artificial intelligence. 
""At the end we still rely on people to manually touch the waste and remove what's not meant to be there on the belt,"" says Tim. ""Then we are sure that at the end of the process we've got sorted material: clean, 99% pure, which can then go to another facility.""
We go down to the factory floor, where all the sorted material is waiting to be collected. Bales of squashed cardboard and paper are stacked up higher than my head, ready to be taken to the paper mill. The plastics and glass will go off to be separated out and processed, while the aluminium and other metals can be taken to smelters to be re-melted and turned into new things, such as bicycles.
Recycling can reduce carbon emissions, because producing new products from recycled objects generally saves energy. Making aluminium cans from recycled scraps of the metal, for instance, is far more energy efficient than making the same from scratch. 
And figures show we are getting better at recycling. According to Wrap's latest survey, we're now very much a nation of recyclers with nine out of 10 people recycling, saving 18 million tonnes of CO2 every year, the same as taking 12 million cars off the road.
""Ultimately, we're all just trying to do our best - we all really want to recycle as much as we can,"" Helen says of the wishcyclers. ""It's down to the companies that produce the packaging to start with to make it simple in terms of design and for the local authorities to be able to collect the stuff.""
But there are limits to what recycling can achieve, when it comes to reducing emissions. Tim says while there has been a ""huge increase"" in recycling rates in recent years, we need to do more, which relies on government investment. 
""Technically we know how to do it, but we need more facilities in the UK, which will create jobs and help the economic recovery,"" he says. And there are those who argue we need to re-think our whole approach to waste - after all, isn't it better to buy less in the first place?

More on the climate summit:
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

320,COP26,Faisal Islam,The Bank of England says cutting carbon could push up prices,2021-11-04,"The governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey does not just have rising prices on his mind this week. He was a delegate at the COP26 climate change talks, and central bankers like him have a big role in the ""rewiring"" of the financial system to achieve net zero.
But in fact there is a connection between these two worlds, says Governor Bailey himself. In an interview with me the governor says that the transition to net zero ""could lead to permanent price level effects"", that we have to ""understand and deal with"". Mr Bailey said people should ""understand that this is the transition path we have to do"".
Indeed he went further, saying: ""I think we are already seeing some effects from climate change on prices now"". In particular he said ""a bit of the gas price story"" - a reference to the 400% increase in prices over the past year - is the result of the world at the same time, shunning coal and chasing the same scarce natural gas supplies.
""As we substitute out of more damaging hydrocarbons, coal obviously being a case in point, during the transition, we will probably see increased demand for some other hydrocarbons [i.e. gas].""
Given that many political voices have tiptoed around the issue that the climate change transition being discussed in Glasgow is likely to have an impact on consumers, this would appear a significant statement of the reality. 
It is of clear interest to an institution which is required in law to model, forecast and ultimately to control inflation.
The transition to a renewable economy will mean a higher level of prices in a long run transition period. The Bank's modelling suggests that unmitigated climate change will also harm the fabric of the economy. 
But the governor believes while it is vital to recognise the economic benefits of saving the planet, it is also necessary that the public has a clear map on the economics of the climate transition.

321,Climate change,Felicity Evans,Climate change: Welsh ministers demand scrapping of mining licence,2021-11-04,"The Welsh government has called for the mining licence for Aberpergwm colliery, near Glynneath, to be cancelled.
Deputy Climate Change Minister Lee Waters said he had urged the UK government to stop ""40 million tonnes of coal"" being extracted ""from Welsh soil"" over the next 18 years.
Welsh ministers have a ""clear policy of stopping using fossil fuels"", he said.
But the mine operator says it supplies niche industries like water filtration and steel production.
It says it provides 160 well-paid jobs in the Vale of Neath area, plus 16 apprenticeships. 
The UK government says final responsibility for licensing coal mines lies with the Welsh government. 
Aberpergwm mine is the only producer of high-grade anthracite in Western Europe and it supplies the nearby Tata steel plant in Port Talbot.
Speaking in the Senedd, Mr Waters said: ""Unless the UK government agree to our request to cancel a licence granted in 1996 at Aberpergwm, some 40 million tonnes of coal will be extracted from this mine by 2039 - a hundred million tonnes of carbon dioxide. 
But Energybuild Ltd, which runs the mine, says Mr Waters' figures are wrong. 
Managing director Rhidian Davies said: ""Anthracite is a highly desirable mineral used predominately for its manufacturing characteristics as opposed to its thermal properties.""
He added that Energybuild ""brought more than Â£100m of investment into the locality"".
And he said carbon products ""will play a significant role in developing sustainable technology of the future, ideally in a circular economy [without waste and pollution]"".
""Our products are in significant demand to support the transition to a sustainable green economy.""
The Welsh government says it is up to the UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), Kwasi Kwarteng, to act to intervene to prevent ""the coal being extracted from Welsh soil"" and they have written to request his intervention.
""We don't want it to happen and the only reason it might happen is because of their [UK government] inaction and their policies,"" Mr Waters said.
But a UK government spokesperson said it was a matter for the Welsh government.
""The Coal Authority is responsible for licensing coal mines, including for Aberpergwm,"" they said
""The BEIS Secretary of State is not involved in this process, as Welsh ministers have the power under the Coal Industry Act to make the final decision on whether coal mining operations in Wales can be progressed.""
But the Welsh government insists they don't have the power to cancel licences that were granted before they were given control over mining regulation. 
Aberpergwm was originally granted a licence to mine coal before licencing powers were handed over to the Welsh government.
The mine operators have recently applied to the Coal Authority for formal recognition that the conditions attached to their original licence have been fulfilled.
Councillor for Glynneath, Del Morgan, said he was worried ""about the prospect of losing good job opportunities from this area, an area that badly needs employment in order to retain our young people in the community"".
Mr Morgan chairs the mine's community liaison committee, where local councillors and members of the community meet the mine operator. 
""I have been privy to some of the plans laid out for the colliery,"" he said. ""These include the developing market for water filtration, where good quality coal is used to remove toxins from the water without stripping the water of salts and important minerals. 
""I also think that over time we will see much greener extraction and production systems develop, which will assist this mining operation to become less intrusive in terms of the world energy debate.""
The debate over the future of Aberpergwm is taking place against the backdrop of the COP26 climate change summit where 40 countries have pledged to move away from coal.
In the run up to the summit Boris Johnson said ""consigning coal to history"" would be key in reducing carbon emissions.
The UK government says it will phase out the use of coal for electricity production by October 2024.

322,Climate change,BBC News,Climate change: Irish government lays out Climate Action Plan,2021-11-04,"The Irish government has published its Climate Action Plan which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 51% by the year 2030.
The programme will cost â¬125bn (Â£107bn), with a combination of public and private sector investment.
Taoiseach (Irish PM) MichÃ©al Martin has described it as an ""important moment"".
The plan, which runs to more than 200 pages, lists a range of emissions reductions for multiple sectors, rather than specifying precise figures.
Those will be laid out next year after the Oireachtas (Irish Parliament) passes a Carbon Budget,
Mr Martin said: ""We will of course debate the various elements of our plan, but on the requirement for urgent action, there is no debate. Failure to act now is not an option.""
The Climate Action Plan seeks a cut in electricity emissions of between 62%-81%.
It says there will be a phasing out of coal and peat-fired electricity generation and wind and solar energy will account for 80% of Ireland's energy supply by the end of the decade.
Homeowners, farmers, businesses and communities will be able to avail of support schemes to help them generate their own electricity and sell any over-supply back to the grid.
The agriculture sector will be asked to reduce its emissions by 22% to 30%.
The plan calls for an improvement in animal breeding and feeding practices, as well as big reductions in the use of chemical nitrogen fertilisers.
When asked about the issue of animal herd sizes on farms, the Taoiseach said: ""The government will work with farmers to secure even more efficiencies. The key objective is reducing emissions - not counting cattle.""
The plan envisages a cut in transport emissions of between 42% and 50%.
It calls for half a million daily journeys to be completed by walking, cycling, or using public transport.
All buses will be replaced with electric vehicles by 2035 and the length of electrified rail will be tripled.
Mr Martin said the plan would be ""transformational"". 
The ""time to step up is now"" and ""we all must have the collective courage to do so"".
The aims to phase out fossil fuels for ""space and water heating in all new buildings"" and will establish a national retrofit plan to provide loans and grants to those in older homes and buildings.
It calls for the use of electric heat pumps and other low carbon technology to be promoted in new and existing buildings.
The Taoiseach added: ""As I said in Glasgow, the scale of the challenge is unprecedented, but it is not too late to act.
""It is now crystal clear that we need to dramatically reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we are putting into the atmosphere, to have hope of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C, keep our ecosystems functioning and ensure that our planet is safe and liveable for generations to come.""
He said the effects of climate change would have a ""massive negative economic impact on Ireland"".
Mr Martin said: ""I recognise that the transition to climate neutrality no later than 2050 will require a profound change in the practices and sectors that support our lifestyle.
""Our homes, workplaces, communities must all adapt but the benefits to all of us and future generations are clear.
""In terms of our public health and our overall quality of life, the plan we are publishing today has the potential to be transformational.
""For some it will be difficult, but the simple truth is that if we delay any further we will face greater costs and be able to seize fewer opportunities.""

324,COP26,BBC News,COP26: Indonesia criticises 'unfair' deal to end deforestation,2021-11-04,"Indonesia has criticised the terms of a global deal to end deforestation by 2030, signalling that the country may not abide by it.
Environment Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar said the authorities could not ""promise what we can't do"".
She said forcing Indonesia to commit to zero deforestation by 2030 was ""clearly inappropriate and unfair"". 
Despite President Joko Widodo signing the forest deal, she said development remained Indonesia's top priority.
The deal, agreed between more than 100 world leaders, was announced on Monday at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. It was the event's first major announcement.
It promises to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, and includes almost Â£14bn ($19.2bn) of public and private funds.
In a Facebook post (in Indonesian), Ms Nurbaya argued that the country's vast natural resources must be used for the benefit of its people.
She cited the need to to cut down forests to make way for new roads.
""The massive development of President Jokowi's era must not stop in the name of carbon emissions or in the name of deforestation,"" she said, referring to Mr Widodo by his nickname.
""Indonesia's natural wealth, including forests, must be managed for its use according to sustainable principles, besides being fair,"" she said.
Experts welcomed the agreement, but they warned a previous deal in 2014 had ""failed to slow deforestation at all"" and said commitments needed to be delivered on.
Felling trees contributes to climate change because it depletes forests that absorb vast amounts of the warming gas CO2.
Meanwhile, Indonesia's Deputy Foreign Minister Mahendra Siregar said that describing the deal as a zero-deforestation pledge was ""false and misleading"".
Indonesia's vast forests are still shrinking, despite a marked slow down in the deforestation rate in recent years.
According to the Global Forest Watch monitoring website, in 2001 the country had nearly 94 million hectares of primary forest - defined as tropical forest that has not been completely cleared and regrown in recent history. 
That area had decreased by at least 10% by 2020.

325,COP26,BBC News,COP26 protesters march on Glasgow defence firm,2021-11-04,"Climate change protesters have targeted UK government offices and a shipyard in Glasgow.
Hundreds of Extinction Rebellion activists assembled at an immigration centre in the Cessnock area before marching to nearby BAE Systems.
Police have lined the gates of the Govan yard where protesters have blocked the road.
Elsewhere, people were briefly stopped from going into a former homeless shelter taken over by activists. 
Douglas Renshaw, of Extinction Rebellion Glasgow, said BAE Systems had been targeted because of what he described as the link between military action and climate change.
He said: ""Our governments have allowed spending on arms to outstrip spending on climate solutions. 
""They've created a brutal world where many face conflict over ravaged resources."" 
Protestoe Bhavini Patel told BBC Scotland she was part of a protest outside the Home Office immigration facility in Cessnock to highlight what will happen to people forced to move from their homes by climate change. 
She said: ""We're going to see lots of displaced form the climate emergency.
""They want to be in their homes, they want to be in their country, they don't want to be here but they do need our support and solidarity right now.""
Protesters gave speeches and banged drums outside the Home Office building before setting off for BAE Systems. 
An occupation called Baile Hoose has taken over an empty homeless shelter in the Tradeston area which is owned by Glasgow City Council. 
The move is designed to give shelter for activists who have not been able to secure accommodation. 
The  Baile Hoose tweeted that its gates had been locked after the police arrived but later said people were being allowed to enter and leave. 
Elsewhere, protesters dressed as the PokÃ©mon character Pikachu have gathered opposite the COP26 conference venue.
They were demanding an end to Japan's support for coal power.
Leading climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg has shared her dismay at the COP26 summit in a tweet that describes it as a ""greenwash festival"". 
On Wednesday five people were arrested at demonstrations across Glasgow.
Scuffles broke out during an Extinction Rebellion demonstration outside the SSE energy company as two activists tried to force their way into the building.
One of those arrested - 60-year-old Andrew Naylor from Edinburgh - has appeared in court accused of spaying paint at three Thames Valley police officers who were on duty. 
He made no plea and was released on bail on condition that he stays away from Glasgow city centre until the end of the summit.
Most of the demonstrations against corporate ""greenwashing"" were peaceful as officers accompanied marchers. 
On Friday, thousands are expected to march through Glasgow with the Fridays for Future movement.
Saturday will see another large march from the COP26 Coalition, with organisers saying tens of thousands are expected.
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

326,COP26,BBC News,My Day at COP26: 'It's my job to keep the summit fed - sustainably',2021-11-04,"Lorna Wilson is in charge of catering at COP26. In the latest in a series of personal accounts from the Glasgow summit, she describes the unique challenges of preparing for the event.
My day usually starts the night before - I like to draw up a plan of action and feel prepped. But nine times out of 10 there's something that throws a spanner in the works.
In the last few days I've been up at 04:00, jumped in the shower, and been on site between 05:00 and 05:30. Then I move around all the different catering outlets, making sure the staff are all where they should be and that the service is delivered.
It's a bit overwhelming as the site is absolutely massive. I'm averaging about 35,000 steps a day. We had 14,000 people here on each of the first two days.
My official job title is head of catering operations at the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) with the company Levy UK + Ireland. I've worked in catering since I was really, really young - I'm from the Isle of Lewis originally. I like working shifts. I really like the diversity and unpredictability - not being in a routine.
But this isn't just a regular event. There's been so much thought put into it. And now everything we've been planning over the past couple of years has come to fruition.
We've changed everything about our operation. We've eradicated single-use cups. Single-use plastics have gone out, too. Instead there are nearly 400 water coolers around the site for delegates to use with reusable bottles.
Every single product line has been looked at individually: where did it come from, can we validate its source?
My Day at COP26:
It goes right the way down to which tea bags we use, which wine we're purchasing - to uniforms, pens and pencils. We've had to ask, where do we get these from?
We have a website that tells you the stories behind all the menu items - where the haggis is made, where in Aberdeen the fish batter was produced, and so on. I've met the farmer we get the cauliflowers from, face to face.
We're working towards a strategy of 80% Scottish food, 15% from the rest of the UK and 5% beyond that. The menu is 40% plant-based and 60% vegetarian overall.
You definitely feel under pressure to get it right. We've been under scrutiny - certain individuals have challenged us on our menus' carbon labelling, which shows how much carbon has been used to produce each item.
But on the whole it's a very low-carbon menu and I think it's been well received by the delegates.
Working on COP26 really does make you think about the bigger picture.
Now when I go shopping I'm hesitant to pick up stuff from outside the country. I'm looking for Scottish produce, Scottish fruit and vegetables. I've been living and breathing it at work and if I bought home plastic bottles of water I'd feel I wasn't practising what I was preaching.
As told to Jon Kelly
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

327,Climate change,BBC News,Insulate Britain blocks roads around Parliament,2021-11-04,"Insulate Britain protesters have blocked two roads around Parliament Square in Westminster.
The group said more than 60 activists had gathered at Bridge Street by Westminster Bridge and the peers' entrance to the Houses of Parliament.
Met Police officers arrested 59 protesters at the scene.
In a statement, Insulate Britain said: ""We have exposed the government's refusal to act on home insulation as cowardly and vindictive.""
It added: ""Their refusal to protect our country and our children from the climate crisis is genocidal and treasonous.""
Insulate Britain - which campaigns for homes to be low energy by 2030 to fight fuel povertyÂ - called itself ""one of the most successful campaigns in history"".
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has accused the group of ""risking lives and ruining journeys"".
Paul Sheeky, a protester from London, said: ""We have been out on the road now for several weeks and a lot of the time the drivers say to us, 'this is not the right way to be doing this, go to Parliament, protest there'. 
""We thought we would take that advice and give it a go.""
One protester told the BBC he had glued himself to a police van to ""highlight the government failure to act on the climate emergency"".
""We have 8,500 people dying each year of fuel poverty - that's 100 people a day during the winter,"" he said.
Insulate Britain has staged various demonstrations in recent months, including ones earlier this week when about 60 activists descended on junction 23 of the M25 near London, junction 6 of the M56 in Manchester and the A4400 in Birmingham.
Since Insulate Britain started its direct action, there have been more than 800 arrests.
Nine members of the group are due to appear at the High Court on 16 November accused of breaching a National Highways injunction.

328,COP26,BBC News,What is net zero and how are the UK and other countries doing?,2021-11-04,"Countries have set out plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, at the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow.
They hope to achieve the target of ""net zero"" by 2050, to help slow global warming.
Net zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. 
Achieving it means reducing emissions as much as possible, as well as balancing out any that remain by removing an equivalent amount.
Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) are released when we burn oil, gas and coal for our homes, factories and transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill. These gases cause global warming by trapping the sun's energy.
Meanwhile, rapid deforestation across the world means there are fewer trees and plants to absorb CO2.
Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, 197 countries agreed to try to keep temperature rises ""well below"" 1.5C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. 
Experts say that to achieve this, net zero must be reached by 2050. 
Not all emissions can be reduced to zero, so those that remain have to be compensated for, or offset - for example, by planting more trees.
Almost every country has embarked on tree planting as a cheap way of reducing carbon, although there may not be enough space for the number required.
Carbon capture and storage has also been suggested as another solution. 
This involves using machinery to remove carbon from the air, then solidifying it and burying it underground.
However, the technology is still emerging, very expensive and as yet unproven.
It won't be easy. 
Reaching net zero will involve moving from fossil fuels to renewable energy for our power, and abandoning vehicles run on petrol and diesel, in favour of those powered by electricity and hydrogen.
Gas central heating will need to be replaced by alternative sources, such as heat pumps. 
Reaching net zero could also mean flying far less in future, and eating less red meat.
Presenting the government's net zero strategy to the House of Commons in the run up to COP26, the government pledged:
The government had already announced a ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, and that all the UK's electricity will come from renewable sources by 2035.
At the time, Shadow Business Secretary Ed Miliband called the latest announcements ""a massive let-down"".
More than 130 countries have pledged to reach net zero emissions before 2050.
However, China - currently the biggest producer of CO2 in the world - says it's aiming for ""carbon neutrality"" by 2060. It hasn't set out exactly what this means or how it will get there. 
Russia - the third-largest producer of oil worldwide - has also pledged to reach net zero by 2060, although its draft commitment hasn't been legally ratified. 
Until recently President Putin dismissed the risks posed by rising temperatures.
US President Joe Biden criticised the Russian and Chinese leaders for not attending the COP26 summit. 
India - the world's fourth biggest emitter of CO2 after China, the US and the EU - has promised to cut its emissions to net zero by 2070. 
Some of the world's most heavily populated countries - including Indonesia - haven't made any net zero commitment.
But many of the announcements which have already come out of the COP26 summit on deforestation, cutting methane and reducing coal are directly linked to helping countries hit their net zero goal.
There's controversy about how some countries might try to reach net zero.
For instance, Country A might record lower emissions if it shuts down energy-intensive industries such as steel production. 
But if Country A then imports steel from Country B, it's effectively handed on its carbon emissions to Country B instead of reducing the sum total of greenhouse gases.
There are schemes that enable rich countries to offset their emissions by paying poorer countries to switch to cleaner fuels. 
However, some climate scientists worry such arrangements could let wealthier nations avoid reducing their own fossil fuel usage. 
And it's hard to say that initiatives funded to offset emissions elsewhere would not have happened anyway.
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

329,COP26,BBC News,COP26: More than 40 countries pledge to quit coal,2021-11-04,"More than 40 countries have committed to shift away from coal, in pledges made at the COP26 climate summit. 
Major coal-using countries including Poland, Vietnam and Chile are among those to make the commitment. 
But some of the world's biggest coal-dependent countries, including China and the US, did not sign up.
In a separate commitment, 20 countries, including the US, pledged to end public financing for ""unabated"" fossil fuel projects abroad by the end of 2022.
Such projects burn fossil fuels, like coal, oil and natural gas, without using technology to capture the CO2 emissions. 
Coal is the single biggest contributor to climate change.
Signatories to the agreement have committed to ending all investment in new coal power generation domestically and internationally. 
They have also agreed to phase out coal power in the 2030s for major economies, and the 2040s for poorer nations, the UK said.
Dozens of organisations also signed up to the pledge, with several major banks agreeing to stop financing the coal industry. 
""The end of coal is in sight,"" UK business and energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said. 
""The world is moving in the right direction, standing ready to seal coal's fate and embrace the environmental and economic benefits of building a future that is powered by clean energy.""
But UK shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said there were ""glaring gaps"" from China and other large emitters, who have not committed to stop increasing coal use domestically. He also noted that there was nothing on the phasing out of oil and gas.
Mr Miliband said the UK government ""has let others off the hook"".
Although progress has been made in reducing coal use globally, it still produced around 37% of the world's electricity in 2019. 
Countries like South Africa, Poland and India will need major investments to make their energy sectors cleaner. 
Juan Pablo Osornio, head of Greenpeace's delegation at COP26, said: ""Overall this statement still falls well short of the ambition needed on fossil fuels in this critical decade.""
""The small print seemingly gives countries enormous leeway to pick their own phase-out date, despite the shiny headline,"" he added. 
There's been such a flurry of announcements on the world's most polluting fossil fuel, that it's hard to see the light for all the (coal) dust.
There are many questions outstanding.
One of the biggest is the list of countries missing from this bonfire of coal commitments - including the US, China and India.
The time scales for phase-out are also a bit woolly - with richer countries promising to end coal by the 2030s, with developing nations in the 2040s.
None of these commitments are binding - again there is no big stick to force countries to do this.
And how many of the plans to stop using coal in developing countries will need financial support from the developed world?
We've already seen the UK, Germany and the US step up to pay South Africa's $8.5bn (Â£6.2bn) to move away from coal. Other countries are said to be interested in following in South Africa's footsteps.
So is there also a question of the rich countries paying others to do what they struggle to do at home?
While the US was notably absent from the coal commitments, it joined 19 other countries - including the UK, Canada and New Zealand - in pledging to stop financing unabated overseas fossil fuel projects.
""Investing in unabated fossil-related energy projects increasingly entails both social and economic risksâ¦ and has ensuing negative impacts on government revenue, local employment, taxpayers, utility ratepayers and public health,"" the signatories of the UK-led initiative said in a joint statement.
The deal saw countries and financial institutions vow to steer their spending into clean energy instead. 
It allowed for exemptions in unspecified ""limited"" circumstances, but said these must be consistent with efforts to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C.
""Ending international finance for all unabated fossil fuels is the next critical frontier we must deliver on,"" UK energy minister Greg Hands said. ""We must put public finance on the right side of history.""
However, major financers of such projects, such as China, Japan and South Korea, did not sign up.
The countries did join G20 nations last month in agreeing to end financial support for new unabated coal plants overseas.

330,COP26,Rachel Schraer & Kayleen Devlin,"Climate change: Facebook fails to flag denial, study finds",2021-11-04,"Climate change denial is spreading unchecked on Facebook, two studies by disinformation researchers have found. 
The Center for Countering Digital Hate and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue said less than 10% of misleading posts were marked as misinformation.
And the CCDH researchers linked the majority of these to just 10 publishers. 
Facebook said this represented a small proportion of climate change content.
The CCDH is a non-profit organisation which monitors and lobbies against online hate and misinformation. 
It found that of 7,000 misleading posts describing climate change as ""hysteria"", ""alarmism"", a ""scam"", or other related terms, only 8% were marked as misinformation.
Facebook pledged to flag climate denial content early this year. 
The CCDH looked at a sample of posts from the past year which attracted roughly 700,000 likes and shares. Researchers used social media analytics tool Newswhip to search for strings of key words including ""climate change"", global warming"" and, ""fraud"", ""hoax"", ""cult"", ""scam"", ""lie"" and so on.
The researchers manually reviewed every post to make sure it met their definition of climate denial and was not a post condemning such beliefs. 
Highly shared articles made false assertions that climate change was not confirmed by science or claimed to debunk it with data. Of these, 69% could be traced back to just 10 ""super-polluter"" publishers - dubbed the ""toxic ten"" - the campaign group found.
In fact, our understanding of climate change comes from analyses of millions of measurements gathered in different parts of the world. And multiple independent teams of scientists have reached the same result - a spike in temperatures coinciding with the onset of the industrial era.
Many of the shared articles also pushed the unsubstantiated belief that ""climate lockdowns"" will be enforced on populations. Yet scientists point out this is highly unlikely given there is no evidence the Covid lockdowns led to a significant improvement for the climate. 
These posts represent the most extreme types of outright climate denial, according to the CCDH. They can't tell us the true scale of climate misinformation on the site but they do indicate climate conspiracy content is spreading without being labelled or removed by Facebook. 
Campaign group Stop Funding Heat, working together with think tank the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), said it had found far more misinformation which more generally ""undermines the existence or impacts of climate change, the human influence on climate change, and the need for urgent action"".
Research published on Thursday analysed 48,700 posts between January and August 2021 and found just 3.6% posts containing climate misinformation included a fact-checking label. 
The group also identified 113 ads on Facebook with messages like ""climate change is a hoax"" between January and October 2021 with an estimated spend of between $58,000-$75,000 (about Â£42,000- 55,000). 
This appears to be a particular issue on Facebook. 
Counter-extremism think tank the ISD discovered during the 2021 German election that most of the top shared posts relating to renewable energy on the site (18 out of 25) either doubted climate change or criticised climate action. They found a similar trend on conversations around fossil fuels, with most of the top shared posts on Facebook (19 out of 25) arguing against climate action. 
On Twitter, on the other hand, the trend was reversed with most posts on the subjects promoting the scientific evidence or in support of climate action.
Although the majority of the publishers of climate denial identified by CCDH were in the US, people from Brazil, India, Poland, Haiti, Mexico, Thailand, Russia, France and Germany were among their top viewers. 
And there were climate denial posts analysed by ISD from the UK, Australia, Russia, India, Poland, South Africa and Japan.
A spokesperson, speaking on behalf of the Facebook platform, said the 700,000 interactions with the posts analysed by the CCDH made up a small fraction of the total 200 million interactions with climate change content on the site.
""We continue to combat climate misinformation by reducing the distribution of anything rated false or misleading by one of our fact-checking partners,"" the spokesperson said.

332,COP26,BBC News,COP26: Has the Glasgow climate summit been poorly organised?,2021-11-04,"The COP26 climate summit in Glasgow has entered its fifth day - with the mood among many of those involved in the talks said to be positive about what has been achieved so far. 
But away from the negotiating rooms, many grassroots delegates and activists have described the organisation of the event - which is being held in the midst of a global pandemic - as ""shambolic"".
The most visible issue has been the huge queues that have formed outside the Scottish Events Campus as delegates attempt to get into the conference venue.
Thousands of delegates from across the world are attending the summit - but the vast majority of them have to use a single entrance to the site, which is officially UN territory for the duration of COP26.
When people do finally make it to the front of the queue they have to go through an accreditation process, including ID checks and proof of a negative Covid test, before they are allowed through the turnstiles into the restricted Blue Zone.
This led to people facing long waits in heavy rain and strong winds on Monday morning - with no protection from the elements being provided by organisers - with the scene being described as ""utter chaos"" by some of those who were there. 
BBC News presenter Mishal Hussain said she was surrounded by delegates in the queue who were missing meetings that they were already due to be in.
And videos appeared to show some people squabbling and pushing forward in an attempt to gain entry, with security stuff struggling to control them.
While the weather improved on Tuesday morning, the queue did not - with delegates again facing lengthy delays that caused some of them to miss meetings and other events. 
But with world leaders including US president Joe Biden leaving Scotland on Tuesday evening, there were reports that the queue - while still long - was not as tightly packed and was moving quicker the following morning.
However, there were still reports of people attempting to jump the queue - and claims that security staff had started ordering delegates to stop taking photographs while waiting in line. 
Public health expert Prof Devi Sridhar of Edinburgh University said the huge queues of people waiting to get in were ""really concerning"" amid the Covid pandemic, with case numbers in Scotland already showing early signs of increasing again. 
The summit organisers sent messages to those participating in the event, urging them to access events remotely where possible because of the ""high level of attendance at the venue"".
They also warned that ""entrance may be limited to certain categories of participants who must be fully present at the venue"".
But some delegates have complained that the remote viewing system has been experiencing technical problems - and have questioned why they are only able to watch the summit online after paying huge sums of money on travel and accommodation costs.  
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson - whose government is hosting the climate conference - apologised to an Israeli minister who said she was unable to access COP26 in her wheelchair on Monday morning. 
Karine Elharrar - who has muscular dystrophy - said she was forced to return to her hotel 50 miles away on Monday after waiting outside for two hours.
Mr Johnson said he was sorry for the ""confusion"" - with Ms Elharrar saying she had managed to ""easily"" get into the conference the next day.

The UK's Environment Secretary, George Eustice, appeared to blame the Israeli delegation for the incident, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme that they ""hadn't made the right provisions at that particular entrance she was coming too"".
Elsewhere, there have been complaints about Glasgow hotels charging a huge premium on their usual prices for the duration of the summit - with BBC Scotland finding one room that normally costs Â£42 a night being advertised at Â£1,400 a night. 
This has led to concerns that delegates from poorer countries or smaller organisations have been priced out of coming.
And visa restrictions on entering the UK because of Covid meant many people from countries in the Global South - which will be worst affected by climate change - were unable to travel to the summit.
The conference is also being held against the backdrop of a strike by refuse staff and street cleaners in Glasgow which has left many bins overflowing, and presumably is not giving international visitors the best impression of the city known to its residents as the Dear Green Place.
Road closures and protests across much of the city have also caused disruption - although there have been relatively few arrests made by police so far.
Climate activist Vic Barrett of the Power Shift Network, who travelled to Scotland from New York for the conference, believes Glasgow has been the most disorganised of any of the COPs he has been to.
He said the combination of the difficulty and expense in getting to Glasgow in the first place - and the issues with actually getting into the venue faced by those who did make it - meant that ""a lot of people were missing and a lot of voices were missing from the conversation"" about climate justice.
BBC Scotland's environment correspondent Kevin Keane said the strict airport-style security checks for admission to the summit were standard at these events because of the presence of world leaders. 
But he said the size of the queue and the long wait to gain entry in the hours before President Biden's arrival on Monday was unusual in his experience.

Add Covid to the mix, with 25,000 delegates having to show their negative tests to security guards from their phones, and progress slows even further.
Kevin said the two previous COPs he has attended did run more smoothly, but they were pre-pandemic and their billing had been nothing like a high as Glasgow.
At the pre-COP in Milan, which started at the end of September, huge queues formed on day one as everyone had to take a physical Covid test to get in.
And the Mediterranean sun on the transparent roof of the entrance marquee saw temperatures inside soar to the point where it had to close in some areas.
At least that's something delegates will not have to worry about in Glasgow.
The UN Climate Change Secretariat has apologised for the ""inconveniences associated with accessing the venue of COP26, both physically and virtually"".
But it emphasised that the summit was taking place under ""exceptional and unprecedent"" circumstances because of Covid, with access having to be reduced to some areas so social distancing could be maintained. 
It said Covid safety rules also meant it had to reduce the number of security and registration lanes for people attempting to enter the venue.
The secretariat added: ""At the same time, we have seen unprecedented interest in this conference, given the importance of addressing climate change, with high numbers of participants registering.
""The World Leaders Summit, with its inevitable security arrangements, had added to the many logistical pressures"".

333,COP26,BBC News,COP26: Quitting coal and rebounding CO2 emissions,2021-11-04,"Here are five things you need to know about the COP26 climate change conference on Thursday.
Countries such as Poland, Vietnam and Chile, which rely heavily on coal - the single biggest contributor to global warming - are committing to move away from it. More than 40 countries have signed up to a statement to quit the use of the fossil fuel, and the UK government says 190 nations and organisations have pledged to stop using it. ""The end of coal is in sight,"" says Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. But some of the world's biggest coal-dependent countries, including Australia, India, China and the US, didn't sign up, which makes for ""glaring gaps"", according to shadow business secretary Ed Miliband. There is also nothing about moving away from oil and gas, he adds. Follow our updates as the COP26 summit focuses on energy.
Global carbon dioxide, or CO2, emissions are set to rebound to near pre-Covid levels. Gas emissions fell by 5.4% during lockdowns in 2020 but the scientific Global Carbon Project report predicts they will rise by 4.9% this year. Scientists, surprised by the findings, say this increase underlines the urgency of action at summits such as COP26 in Glasgow.
When Israeli minister Karine Elharrar couldn't attend COP26 because it wasn't wheelchair-accessible, it was a reflection of how many disabled people often feel - ignored and left out of climate change conversations. This is despite the United Nations Human Rights Council saying those with disabilities are among the people most ""adversely affected in an emergency"". So why are they so affected by climate change and what can we do about it? We've taken a look.

Sgt Lynsey Buchanan-Barlas and her police dog Nico have been searching Glasgow's streets for explosives weeks before and during COP26. Although there are different things going on with lots of important people at the summit, it's all about keeping everyone safe. ""The dogs are the brains of the operation, I just hold the lead,"" she says. Read more about their team work.

Net zero is a phrase that keeps popping up but do you know what it means? The simplest way of explaining it is that it means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Those gases, such as CO2, are released when we burn oil, gas and coal for our homes, factories and transport. So reducing those emissions and balancing out any remaining ones, by planting trees that absorb carbon for example, achieves net zero.

334,Climate change,Rachael Garside,Trees: Powys farmer fined Â£15k over government scheme errors,2021-11-04,"A farmer said he was given a Â£15,000 fine after some of the trees he planted in a Welsh government scheme were in the wrong place - some by a few inches. 
David Mills, from Lower Chapel, Powys, decided to plant 13,000 trees on 20 acres of his land as part of the Glastir Woodland Creation scheme. 
Earlier this year, Mr Mills was told he had contravened the original plans. 
The Welsh government said it could not comment on a case which was subject to an appeal. 
It added it had a ""statutory obligation"" to enforce the rules, but it was reviewing the current rules of the scheme. 
Mr Mills said he felt like he had ""done his bit"" to encourage biodiversity on his farm and tackle climate change when he planted the trees. 
But he received a letter from Rural Payments Wales telling him he had contravened original plans - using satellite images as evidence - and that he faced a Â£15,000 fine. 
He said: ""We'd planted the right number of trees, I'd got someone from Welsh government to plan and draw up all the diagrams. He organised the planting and a contractor did the fencing.  
""I just assumed everything was correct. It's a ridiculous situation."" 
He said he had to borrow money from his son to pay the fine straight away, as it was accruing heavy interest, and that he had been unsuccessful in an appeal. 
He said Rural Payments Wales told him the tree planting differed from the original plan, in some cases by as little as 10cm (4in). 
""It's been horrific,"" Mr Mills added. 
""I feel like I've been tricked and cheated, and the hypocrisy when you see someone [from Welsh government] saying 'we want to plant more trees' and this is the way I'm treated for doing what I thought was environmentally friendly. 
""I want to increase biodiversity - I'm not doing it for any other reason other than I care."" 
Mr Mills said farmers should be supported, rather than penalised, for planting trees and maintaining them. 
He said: ""I would have expected a pat on the back, but instead of that I get a Â£15,000 fine."" 
His appeal has been supported by National Farmers' Union (NFU) Cymru, which said it is representing two other farms in similar situations but facing even higher fines. 
Stella Owen, a county adviser, said she was concerned about the reputational damage to the tree planting scheme. 
She said it was not just about the financial penalty as farmers found it ""scarring"" to have committed to the scheme and then feel like they have failed.
""That's no help to anybody, that doesn't deliver the aspirations of what Welsh government want,"" she added.
""That doesn't do anything for the mental health of the farmer and to all intents and purposes, it will just put people off.
""If they want that uptake, then there has to be more leniency in terms of a simple, robust scheme which can allow changes.
""There is absolutely no need for this level of financial penalty to be imposed five years down the line."" 
The scheme was launched in 2015 with the aim of combating climate change, increasing biodiversity and establishing habitats for wildlife.
Farmers were offered grants to plant trees and payments to maintain them over 12 years, which feed into plans for a National Forest for Wales. 
The Welsh government said: ""Contracts can be verified by on-farm visits or the use of latest available aerial imagery. 
""When the scheme verification shows the conditions of the contract have not been met, the Welsh government has a statutory obligation to apply European Commission rules concerning the recovery of payments and application of over-declaration penalties.
""We are committed to supporting farmers to create more woodland in order to tackle climate change.""

335,COP26,Luned Phillips & Caroline Evans,Climate change: How recycled hair helps cut carbon,2021-11-04,"""It's easy to think that we are acting on our own, that we are just one drop in the ocean.""
Climate warrior Grant Peisley is echoing what many feel: that making a change is like an impossible task.
But as world leaders talk in Glasgow at COP26, the major summit on climate change, people like Grant are doing little things which cumulatively make a big difference.
These range from a community garden, building green walls or recycling hair.
Cardiff business Create Salon is using hair to tackle climate change. 
It's recycled into ""booms"" designed to soak up oil from rivers, lakes and oceans.
Hair holds onto grease until it's washed, so, in theory, it can be used repeatedly.
Salon owner Kasey Perks said: ""We are recycling up to 95% of our waste, a lot of it is hair.
""At the moment there are a lot of clients wanting big changes so there is a lot of hair being cut off.""
The aim is to make their salon ""sustainably led"".
Ms Perks said: ""If hair is not disposed of it can release a lot of greenhouse gases and a lot of the time it ends up in the rubbish bin in landfill and creates harmful greenhouse gases.
""When we knew we were going to start our own salon that was at the forefront of our business plan, so we did a lot of research.""
In Blaenau Ffestiniog, Gwynedd, a green wall has been planted on the high street.
Shops also put up posters to advertise what each business is doing to fight climate change, and encourage others.
Grant Peisley is from Datblygiadau Egni Gwledig (DEG), an organisation working to assist this.
He said: ""We have groups that are doing all sorts of planting and rewilding. We've got cafes going without plastics, a no-plastic shop, and people are really interested in how they can support the local economy by buying locally and reducing carbon emissions in our produce.""
The aim is to build enthusiasm by demonstrating how individual actions make a difference.
""When we all come together, all these steps come together,"" he said.
""It's easy to think that we are acting on our own that we are just one drop in the ocean and the changes I make at home aren't going to make a difference, but what we are seeing here in our communities in north Wales is that there are lots of people taking lots of actions and all those actions are building up to be really meaningful.
""We need to engage everybody in the process of working against climate change and this is a great way to do it.""
DEG wants to host climate assemblies in five locations across north Wales over the next two years.
""We will be able to hear from people about what they would like and what kind of actions they would like to see in their areas,"" he said.
In an industrial estate in Cardigan, Ceredigion, Raphaelle Fieldhouse helps people plant trees in a forest community garden.  
She said: ""Everything is edible or helps the environment. It doesn't make sense to fly apples and chillies over from South Africa to Wales whilst they can grow well here.
""We're close to town and people can walk here, and it's important that the community grows its own food.""

336,Climate change,BBC News,LSE becomes first carbon-neutral university,2021-11-04,"The London School Of Economics and Political Science (LSE) has become the first UK university to be independently verified as carbon neutral.
The university has reduced direct emissions by 44% since 2005 following a Â£4.8m investment in energy efficiency.
To gain carbon-neutral PAS 2060 status for the year 2020-21 the university also funded 80,090 sq m of rainforest to offset carbon emissions.
A spokesman said LSE hoped to be ""an inspiration for others"".
Prof Nicholas Stern, chair of LSE's climate change and the environment institute, said: ""Higher education institutions have a duty to show leadership and advocate for decisive action in tackling climate change, the challenge of our times.""
The university's carbon-neutral status was verified by the British Standards Institution (BSI). The LSE now has PAS 2060 status, a carbon-neutrality certification created by the government, for the academic year 2020-21.
LSE began updating campus and residential buildings in 2015. Solar panels, pipe insulation and LED lights were fitted, while more energy-efficient boilers and chillers were installed.
The university has procured all the electricity it uses from 100% renewable sources such as solar and wind since 2009.
About a third of the university's carbon emissions have been offset through funding 176,200 trees in rainforest across three continents.
The carbon offset is the equivalent of 20 million kilometres driven in a petrol vehicle, according to the Compensate Foundation, LSE's partner in carbon-reduction projects.
The university is working to become net-zero carbon by 2030.

337,Climate change,BBC News,"North Sea firms expect a big increase in non-fossil fuel business, a report finds",2021-11-04,"North Sea firms expect to see their share of business outside oil and gas more than double by 2030, according to a new report.
Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce (AGCC) said its survey findings suggested companies predicted 47% of business would come from outside the sector, compared with 21% now.
More than half aim to increase headcount in the next three years.
The findings came in the 34th AGCC Oil and Gas Survey.
However, the Oil and Gas Transition Survey warned a lack of skilled talent could be an obstacle to transition.
The survey was carried out in partnership with the Fraser of Allander Institute and KPMG UK.
It found 69% of companies in the sector expected revenue to rise in 2022.
And three quarters reported being either moderately or extremely optimistic about Aberdeen, Scotland and the UK playing a leading role as a future energy hub. 
The survey found two in five companies in the sector had not yet committed to carbon neutral targets.
Martin Findlay, senior partner at KPMG in Aberdeen, said: ""As we cautiously emerge from the pandemic, the direction of travel is clear amongst oil and gas companies who are gearing up for a decade of rapid sustainable transformation.
""Most oil and gas firms are now doing far more than paying lip service to sustainability with the vast majority believing that strong sustainability credentials are critical to their long-term success.""
He said firms now faced ""a clear fork in the road - evolve and thrive or be left behind"".
Mr Findlay added: ""It's clear the industry is on the cusp of transformation, and with many businesses having already chosen their path - and heading towards a greener future, the question is how many more will follow and how quickly.""
Russell Borthwick, chief executive at AGCC, said the results illustrated that firms in the sector envisage the transition ""picking up pace rapidly over the next decade"".
He said: ""The industry is clearly committed to taking a leading role in delivering the UK's net-zero ambitions.""
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

339,COP26,Keiligh Baker,Climate change: Why are disabled people so affected by the climate crisis?,2021-11-04,"Israeli minister Karine Elharrar made headlines around the world when it emerged she couldn't attend the COP26 summit on Monday because it wasn't wheelchair-accessible.
For many disabled people, it was a reflection of the way they often feel ignored or left out of conversations about climate change.
Yet disabled people are among those most ""adversely affected in an emergency"", according to the United Nations Human Rights Council. And those emergencies - from wildfires to flooding - are likely to become more frequent because of the climate crisis.
So why are disabled people so affected by climate change and what can we do about it?
In July 2018, a heatwave hit Montreal, Canada. Temperatures soared to 35.5C (95.9F) for days. Hospitals became busy with those experiencing the effects of heat and 61 people died. A quarter of those had schizophrenia.
""That's 500 times their share of the population,"" says Prof SÃ©bastien Jodoin, a climate change specialist from McGill University, who has multiple sclerosis and studies the relationship between human rights, disability and the climate crisis. 
Many people with schizophrenia take anti-psychotic medication to treat their symptoms. It can make patients less tolerant to heat, increasing the risk of heatstroke and severe dehydration, which can prove fatal. 
Professor Jodoin says it's the lack of communication between authorities and at-risk communities that exacerbates these situations.
""People who live with schizophrenia tend to have less of a social network, they tend to be more poor,"" he says. ""These are the underlying effects of how disability will increase vulnerability or engender vulnerability, to climate change.""
Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather, which is likely to lead to more heatwaves and fuel wildfires. A warming atmosphere also makes extreme rainfall and flooding more likely.
Professor Jodoin says what happened in Montreal is a snapshot of what is to come.
In 2019, California was hit with a series of outages as companies shut down power to prevent wildfires spreading. Gerald Niimi, from Santa Rosa in North California, had managed a chronic lung disease for years and relied on an oxygen ventilator to help him breathe.
But when the power-outage hit, his ventilator stopped. He and his wife fled their home and desperately searched for a working vent, but failed. Gerald died two days later. 
Energy supplier Pacific Gas & Electric later admitted it had failed to notify thousands of customers, including hundreds with medical conditions, before shutting off their power. 
During the wildfires, some disabled Californians had difficulty fleeing their homes. Those who were able to escape found many of the emergency centres providing water, bathrooms and a safe space, were not accessible.
This summer, 12 disabled care home residents in the town of Sinzig, in Germany, died when sudden flooding hit - they had been unable to evacuate. The floods have been linked to climate change by scientists and politicians. 
Dr Charles Williams, a climate scientist and research fellow at the University of Bristol, has spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). ""As a wheelchair-user, I would not be able to get into a rubber dinghy to be evacuated,"" he says.
Similar stories emerged after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, causing serious flooding. A report, by the US-based National Council on Disabilities, found disabled people struggled to access support. 
Most evacuation busses did not have wheelchair lifts, many of the emergency shelters were inaccessible and people with visual and hearing impairments were unable to obtain local safety information.
Weather-related disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, have increased five-fold over the past 50 years. So what needs to happen to better support disabled people?
Andy Greene, from Disabled People Against Cuts (DPAC), believes disabled people need to be more involved in climate change discussions - particularly when new laws are brought in. 
He says governments often overlook the impact of legislation on those who are disabled, pointing to the crackdown on plastic straws as one example.
After a Sir David Attenborough documentary highlighted how take-away containers were littering the seas, a public outcry led to legislation banning single-use plastic straws. 
The new law included an exemption for those who need to use plastic straws for medical reasons, but Mr Greene says many disabled people were still adversely affected as they rely on the availability of plastic straws to drink independently. 
Replacements like metal or pasta straws are hard and can cause damage if, for instance, the person using them were to slip or spasm while drinking. And paper straws tend to collapse. That's why bendable plastic is important for those who can't pick up a cup.
""Disabled people [who use straws] are a very small group, but this ban has a real impact on them - while having a minimal actual real impact on the structural effects of climate change and global warming,"" he says.
He believes it's another example of disabled people being forgotten and left behind. 
The term ""eco-ableism"" is now being  used to describe this sort of discrimination. It refers to the failure of decision-makers and activists to consider that some environmental actions make life more difficult for disabled people - such as removing disabled parking bays to make way for cycle lanes. 
At COP26, some side events will specifically explore disability and climate change. One event will look at inclusive designs for climate resilient cities, while another will highlight the impact of climate change on the health of disabled people.
Prof Jodoin says governments often do not think of the ""specific requirements of people with disabilities"". But he sees COP26 as ""an opportunity to push disability rights"".
Dr Williams says ""there are reasons to be hopeful"" about tackling climate change. He says the problem so far has been the ""apparent lack of motivation and willpower"" to make changes on an individual and political level.  
""Only time will tell if these attitudes will change. There has been a dramatic shift in the last 10 years, but this needs to continue.""

340,Climate change,Paul Rincon,Climate change: Carbon emissions show rapid rebound after Covid dip,2021-11-04,"Global carbon dioxide emissions are set to rebound to near the levels they were at before Covid, in a finding that has surprised scientists.
The amount of planet-heating gas released in 2020 fell by 5.4% as the pandemic forced countries to lock down.
But a scientific report by the Global Carbon Project predicts CO2 emissions will rise by 4.9% this year.
It shows the window is closing on our ability to limit temperature rise to the critical threshold of 1.5C.
This rise in carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere underlines the urgency of action at summits like COP26 in Glasgow, scientists say.
Important deals have been struck at the meeting this week, on limiting emissions of methane and on curbing deforestation. 
Yet emissions from coal and gas are predicted to grow more in 2021 than they fell the previous year - though carbon released from oil use is expected to remain below 2019 levels.
Dr Glen Peters, from the Center for International Climate Research (Cicero) in Oslo, Norway, said: ""What many of us were thinking in 2020 - including me - was more of a recovery spread out over a few years, as opposed to a big hitch in 2021.
""That's where the surprise comes for me - that it happened so quick, and also there's a concern that there's still some recovery to come.""
This rapid rebound in emissions is at odds with the ambitious CO2 cuts required in order to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C. This is the increase viewed by scientists as the gateway to dangerous levels of global warming.
The 16th annual Global Carbon Budget report was compiled by more than 94 authors who analysed economic data and information on emissions from land activities, such as forestry.

It shows that, if we continue along as we are and don't cut emissions, there's a 50% likelihood of reaching the 1.5C of warming in about 11 years. This concurs with the findings in a recent UN report that suggested we would get there by the early 2030s.
Prof Corinne Le QuÃ©rÃ©, from the University of East Anglia, said: ""To limit climate change to 1.5C, emissions of CO2 need to reach net zero by 2050. Doing this in a straight line would mean cutting global emissions down by 1.4 billion tonnes of CO2 each year.""
The fall in 2020 was 1.9 billion tonnes, but that was in the lockdown.
So reducing emissions by an amount roughly equivalent to that in the post-lockdown period presents a daunting challenge. But the scientists stress that it remains achievable.
Read more about the COP26 summit here.
""Personally, I think [the 1.5C goal] is still alive, but the longer we wait, the harder it will get... we need immediate action and reductions,"" said co-author Pierre Friedlingstein, from the University of Exeter.
Prof Le QuÃ©rÃ© concurred: ""This decrease of 1.4 billion tonnes each year is a decrease that is very large indeed, but is feasible with concerted action. We need to limit climate change as low as possible and 1.5C is a good target to maintain.""
Emissions in China are expected to be 5.5% higher in 2021 than in 2019 and are also projected to rise in India, with a 4.4% increase in 2021 relative to the pre-pandemic level.
Dr Peters said commentators should remember that, while China is responsible for nearly 30% of global carbon emissions, that left another 70% for the rest of the world to tackle.
The superpower has also demonstrated weaker economic growth in the past decade and has been switching to low-carbon energy sources at a faster rate than many other countries.
Its emissions growth this year is related to stimulus packages - focused on heavy industry - which are in turn a response to the Covid-related slowdown. 
""China is doing very well on many dimensions: it's deploying solar, it's deploying wind, electric buses, electric vehicles, and so there's lots of positive things going on in China,"" Dr Peters explained. ""But unfortunately, the stimulus packages often tend to focus on industrial sectors - construction, steel, cement. This requires coal. 
""If China can turn that around, it has plenty of potential to reduce emissions because it has so much potential for large-scale deployment of solar and wind [power] that other countries don't have.""
At COP26 this week, India pledged to reach net zero - where its emissions are reduced and any remaining ones balanced out by projects such as tree planting - by 2070. Like China, it has installed lots of wind and solar capacity, but fossil fuel sources have also been growing.
Projected 2021 emissions in the US, European Union and the rest of the world remain, respectively, 3.7%, 4.2%, and 4.2% below their 2019 levels - in large part due to policies designed to reduce emissions from fossil fuels.

343,COP26,BBC News,COP26: Five arrests as hundreds march in Glasgow,2021-11-03,"Five activists have been arrested as hundreds of climate change protesters marched through Glasgow.
Scuffles broke out during an Extinction Rebellion demonstration outside the SSE energy company as two activists tried to force their way into the building.
Police said other arrests were made following ""assaults"" on officers who had paint sprayed in their faces.
Most of the demonstrations against corporate ""greenwashing"" were peaceful as officers accompanied marchers.
The biggest protests of the summit so far began with hundreds of campaigners gathering in the city centre to highlight what they see as the exaggeration of green credentials by big businesses. 
Some then headed for the offices of SSE where police and security staff prevented activists entering the building, and four arrests were made including two people who, according to the police, sprayed paint at officers. 
Gary Ritchie, Assistant Chief Constable of Police Scotland, said they received first aid at the scene before opting to return to the operation, which he described as ""very effective"" and ""very well planned"".
Another protest took place outside the offices of JP Morgan, where a green flare was let off. 
Extinction Rebellion said about 500 demonstrators were later ""kettled"" at St Vincent Street before being allowed to move off with a heavy police escort towards the city's Broomielaw next to the River Clyde.
Amid shouting and pushing, several protesters fell and police medics helped at least one woman who was injured.
ACC Ritchie said most protesters had been ""fairly compliant"" with police ""in negotiations"" with the group about their intentions.
""They have told us they would like to proceed to another part of the city and we have agreed to that,"" he said. ""But for public safety reasons we will be escorting the protesters as they make their way to that location.""  
ACC Ritchie said police would ""protect the rights of people who wish to peacefully protest or counter-protest at COP26, balanced against the rights of the wider community"". 
He added: ""We will provide a proportionate policing response to any protest and violence will not be tolerated. 
""Assaults on officers, who put their safety at risk every day to keep the public safe and have adopted a facilitative and rights-based approach to protest, is totally unacceptable.""
Eyewitness: Cameron Buttle, BBC Scotland reporter in Glasgow city centre
For around two hours hundreds of public order police were chasing a group of protesters around the centre of Glasgow. 
It was a hugely difficult operation to police; as soon as a street was blocked the protesters disappeared down a lane or backtracked and took a different route. 
Eventually a group of about 150 were held in a block just off Renfield Street. 
It was noisy, passionate and occasionally very tense.
I did see some scuffles breaking out in front me but it calmed down very quickly.  
Eventually the police cordon moved slowly through the city taking the group down towards the main conference venue. 
Some protesters complained about the police operation, saying it was over the top and heavy handed. 
The police said they feared that main routes were going to be blocked and said the action was proportionate.
Campaigners also used the demonstrations to object to the planned Cambo oil field off Shetland,  on  the anniversary of the Queen inaugurating the flow of North Sea oil in 1975.
Friends of the Earth Scotland, along with the campaign groups Platform and Stop Cambo, took part in protest events.
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said an environmental review of the new Cambo oil field should be carried out before extraction begins.
The UK government's Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has backed the project, saying Cambo is ""priced in"" to the UK government's plans to reduce emissions.
Rosemary Harris, of Platform, said there should be no new investment in oil and gas.
She said: ""Any new oil and gas production is continuing to support a declining industry. There's a lot of talk about it being important for jobs, but they should be creating pathways for workers outside oil and gas.""
Inside the conference hall, UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak promised to cut carbon emissions by rewiring the ""entire global financial system"".
He said the plan would help persuade firms investing in fossil fuels to instead put their money into green energy and technologies.  
About 450 of the world's biggest banks, insurers and pension companies, which control about Â£100tn, have signed up. 
More than 100 world leaders were in Glasgow for the first two days of the COP26 summit but most have now left, leaving delegations to continue the negotiations.
US President Joe Biden flew out on Tuesday night after a two-day visit.

345,COP26,BBC News,My Day at COP26: âMy police dog doesn't care if Biden is here - he gets on with the jobâ,2021-11-03,"For weeks, Police Scotland's Sgt Lynsey Buchanan-Barlas and her dog Nico have been searching Glasgow's streets for explosives ahead of COP26. In the latest of a series of first-person accounts from the summit, she explains how they work together as a team.
Everyone in the police will tell you they think being a dog handler is the best job in the force. It doesn't feel like work a lot of the time. You have to pinch yourself and remember you're getting paid for it.
Nico, my police dog, is six and a half. He's a working cocker spaniel and I've had him since he was just over a year old. He's actually a rescue dog - I think he'd been too much for his previous owner. I went through a course with him and ended up with a licence in searching for explosives.
He lives at home with me, my family, my two young kids - my two pet dogs as well.
I have a really strong bond with him. Whenever I'm at work he won't look at anyone else. Other officers will try to talk to him, but he just blanks them. He's always so focused on me. I put the harness on him and he wants to work - that's all he wants to do.
In my day-to-day role, I'm the national dog training supervisor for all the police dogs in Scotland. But for COP26, I'm basically acting as an explosives search dog handler.
We've been working on the summit since 18 October. This is my third week doing quite long shifts, searching whenever there's a need to search. Obviously, there are different things going on with lots of important people at venues around the city. It's all about keeping people safe, at the end of the day.
It's very methodical work. We need to cover every square inch. 
But the dogs are professional and know what they're doing. If anything has been planted with explosives in it, the dogs will find it. 
I always say, they're the brains of the operation. I just hold the lead.
My Day at COP26:
Nico and I have been searching hotels around the city with lots of visitors and staff coming and going. The dogs are quite well trained in that they will work around people. 
But searching the kitchen area is an absolute nightmare because, at the end of the day, Nico's just a dog. He wants to get in among the food as best he can - so that's a bit of a challenge.
Working at COP26 is a real privilege. I'm Glaswegian through and through - I work in Glasgow, I live on the outskirts of the city. I'm super-proud to be part of it.
But Nico doesn't go: ""Oh, this is massive. The president's here."" He just goes about his job and that's great for me. It's what we're trained to do day in, day out.
As told to Jon Kelly

346,COP26,Daniel Kraemer,COP26: What do the poorest countries want from climate summit?,2021-11-03,"Developing countries are the most vulnerable to the damage caused by climate change, such as floods, droughts and wildfires. 
Addressing the needs of less wealthy and smaller countries is vital for the COP26 climate negotiations in Glasgow, where leaders are being asked to agree on new commitments to tackle climate change. 
The least developed countries have set out their priorities for negotiations. They want richer and developed countries to:
There is deep frustration among the leaders of developing nations that the richest in the world have not met their previous commitments. 
Kenya's president Uhuru Kenyatta said: ""Before making new pledges, start by fulfilling the existing ones.""
This video can not be played
Developing countries have historically contributed a very small proportion of the damaging emissions that drive climate change - and currently the richest 1% of the global population account for more than twice the combined emissions of the poorest 50%.
These poorer countries are also more vulnerable to the effects of extreme weather because they are generally more dependent on the natural environment for food and jobs, and have less money to spend on mitigation. 
Over the last 50 years, more than two out of three deaths caused by extreme weather â including droughts, wildfire and floods â occurred in the 47 least developed countries.
In 2009, richer countries committed to finding $100bn a year by 2020 from public and private sources, to address the needs of developing countries. 
The money is to help pay for measures to reduce dangerous emissions and protect from the effects of extreme weather, such as better flood defence systems and investment in renewable energy sources.
However, total commitments had only reached $80bn by 2019, and the $100bn target is now unlikely to be met before 2023.
Securing an agreement on how to meet the commitments to developing countries - and potentially go further - is crucial if the world is going to achieve its aim to keep global temperature rises below 1.5C.
Arriving in Glasgow for the summit, Malawi's president Lazarus Chakwera said: ""It's not a charity act. So pay up or perish with us.""
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has put reaching $100bn as one of his four priorities for the negotiations in Glasgow. 
He said that richer nations had ""reaped the benefits of untrammelled pollution for generations, often at the expense of developing countries"", and that they have a ""duty"" to support developing nations with technology, expertise and money.
""We are negotiating for our survival,"" says Tagaloa Cooper, of the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme - an organisation made of up members from Pacific island countries and territories.
Rising sea levels make some of these island nations the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, but Ms Cooper says a lack of resources means they don't have the ""luxury"" of sending large delegations. 
""Some of our most vulnerable will struggle to have a voice, and be heard, in these negotiations.""
Navigating Covid-safe travel to the Glasgow conference has been an obstacle for many delegations, particularly the Pacific islands, where infection rates have remained low during the pandemic. 
Only four Pacific island heads of state are reported to be travelling to the summit, with others being represented by smaller teams and ambassadors.
Negotiators staying behind and participating remotely may be disadvantaged by unreliable internet access and time differences. Samoa, for instance, is 13 hours ahead of the UK. 
Developing countries usually have less of a voice on the international stage, so it helps to form groups or blocks to amplify their cause.
The Least Developed Countries group is a 46-nation bloc that includes Senegal, Bangladesh and Yemen and represents one billion people.
These countries can create stronger negotiating positions when ""priorities and interests are aligned"", says Sonam Wangdi, the current chairman, from Bhutan. 
""This crisis isn't being treated like a crisis. That has to change here in Glasgow,"" he says. 
If there is to be a final agreement, all 197 UN member states that are signed up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have to sign.
That means the final agreement must be acceptable to both richer and developing countries.
World leaders failed to secure a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen in 2009, partly because a handful of developing countries including Sudan and Tuvalu opposed the final agreement.

348,COP26,Angie Brown,COP26: 'I'm on cloud nine after shaking the hand of US president',2021-11-03,"US President Joe Biden has returned home to America after attending the UN climate conference COP26 in Glasgow.
During his one night stay in Scotland he met dozens of people - one of whom was Rachel King.
She works at the Dalmahoy Hotel in Kirknewton where the president was staying with his entourage.
The 30-year-old says she is still on ""cloud nine"" from meeting the world leader in the canteen area of the venue.
""I'll remember this for the rest of my life,"" she said.
Rachel's encounter happened on Monday evening as the 46th American president headed to his room after arriving at the West Lothian hotel and country club.
She said she walked up to Mr Biden, who immediately offered his hand, and said: ""It's so nice to meet you.""
Rachel replied: ""I'm very honoured to meet you Mr President.""
Only last week she was planning corporate events in her role as senior sales manager.
Rachel told BBC Scotland she texted her dad in capital letters after the meeting writing: ""I just shook the hand of the president of the United States of America.""
On meeting Mr Biden, she said: ""He had a very warm and firm handshake and there was a real presence about him.
""He's tall, kind, very smiley and polite. 
""He seemed genuinely kind.""
Although it had all been ""a bit of a blur"" she said it was the highlight of the last three months of planning his visit.
She said: ""I was giddy, excited and in disbelief at him being there. He had his protection team there and had had a long day at COP26 but he still had time to shake my hand, he was very gentlemanly.
""I've been on cloud nine since.""
While Mr Biden was at the hotel so too were his advisers, drivers, press staff and protection team. There were also snipers on the five star hotel's roof, in nearby bushes and in the grounds.
Jordan King, who is operations manager of the Ratho Park pub opposite the Dalmahoy Hotel entrance, told BBC Scotland how he saw weeks of secret service activity in the run up to the presidential visit.
He said: ""I'm American from Los Angeles and now live here with my wife running this family pub and what are the chances the boss comes to stay over the road for a night. 
""There were 40 police officers in a line here and many riot vans.""
Mr King added: ""When his [Mr Biden] motorcade arrived it was very daunting, very serious. Heavily armoured cars, mobile command centres with radar dishes and they blast in very quickly, they don't pause for anything.
""His stay here has been exciting and brought a wee buzz. Regardless of your politics he's in charge of the free world and so the effort involved to have him stay here has been immense.""
Mr Biden flew to Scotland on Monday morning and undertook a full day of engagements. He was greeted at the COP26 venue by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and went on to make a short address to fellow world leaders.
The day ended with a Royal reception at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.
He dined with Prince Charles and Camilla, formally known as the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay when in Scotland, plus Prince William and wife Catherine.
Mr Biden was back at the conference on Tuesday before heading home on Air Force One from Edinburgh Airport at 22;00.
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

349,COP26,Reality Check team,COP26: What's the climate impact of private jets?,2021-11-03,"There has been criticism of the number of world leaders and other delegates who have travelled to the COP26 summit in private jets.
How much environmental damage do they do - and did leaders have any choice?
Plane spotters at Prestwick Airport in South Ayrshire have been enjoying the unusual range of aircraft arriving there.
And it hasn't just been those ferrying the leaders themselves - there have been cargo aircraft arriving, carrying helicopters and vehicles for motorcades.
We know, for example, that President Biden has one of his armoured vehicles, known as ""The Beast"", with him in Glasgow. He also had one in Rome on Sunday.
FlightRadar24, which tracks flights, has looked at the number of non-commercial flights into Glasgow, Prestwick and Edinburgh airports since 27 October, excluding cargo, regular or local journeys.
It has found that there were about 182 such flights, which is about double the total for the previous six days. That excludes some national chartered flights, such as President Biden's plane, Air Force One.
Aviation analytics company Cirium told the BBC there was a total of 76 flights involving private jets, or VIP flights, arriving in and around Glasgow in the four days leading up to 1 November.
Private jets have also been flying from Glasgow Airport, in Paisley, where they have dropped off passengers, to Glasgow Prestwick Airport, in Ayrshire, where they have been parking - a distance of about 41km.
Flights produce greenhouse gases - mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) - from burning fuel. These contribute to global warming.
Emissions per kilometre travelled are known to be significantly worse than any other form of transport.
But this varies considerably depending on size, occupancy levels and efficiency. Private jets generally produce significantly more emissions per passenger than commercial flights. 
There are many different models of private jet, but the Cessna Citation XLS - consistently one of the most popular - burns 189 gallons (857 litres) of aviation fuel an hour on average.
If we were to consider the journey from Rome to Glasgow on a private jet - a journey that some of the G20 leaders made to get to COP 26 - that would take around two hours and 45 minutes, requiring 2,356 litres of jet fuel. 
The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) says 2.52kg of carbon dioxide is emitted for every litre of aviation turbine fuel burned. Therefore this flight would produce 5.9 tonnes of CO2.
However, BEIS recommends that to ""capture the maximum climate impact"" of flights, CO2 emissions figures should be multiplied by 1.9 to reflect the effect of non-CO2 emissions released by planes at high altitude, which, scientists say, increase the warming effect. 
Therefore, the total emissions for this flight would be 11.3 tonnes of CO2 equivalent, and with a capacity of nine, each passenger would be responsible for 1.2 tonnes on their journey.
If, however, our world leaders had decided to take a commercial flight from Rome to Glasgow their emissions would have been a quarter of a tonne each. Even though a commercial flight uses more fuel per hour, it is able to fly far more passengers than a private jet and therefore produces fewer emissions per person. 
""A huge amount of fuel is used during takeoff and landing of a plane, no matter how many people you have on board. So an already polluting mode of transport (commercial aviation) becomes even worse (with private jets),"" said Dr Debbie Hopkins, an expert in decarbonising transport at University of Oxford.

In April, US President Joe Biden hosted a virtual climate summit for world leaders, at which some commitments were made.
But several have been talking at this summit about the value of meeting in person.
The president of Sierra Leone said: ""I have travelled extensively because I have to be there - we're talking about challenges and the environment in Sierra Leone. If I don't come here, how will they know?""
UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said face-to-face talks were needed for ""crunch negotiations"" such as this.
Another question being asked on social media is why the meeting of the G20 that happened right before COP26 had to be in Rome.
The G20 is a group of big economies plus the European Union. 
It has a summit once a year, hosted by whichever country is holding the rotating presidency of the group.
If COP26 had been in November 2020, as originally planned, it would have been followed by the G20 summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Update 3 November: The piece has been amended to change US gallons to UK gallons in the example of the Cessna plane.

350,Climate change,Zoe Johnson,Farmers of tomorrow from the East of England see sustainable future,2021-10-31,"Sustainability is the future of agriculture in this country, according to the farmers of the future.
In the run-up to COP26 climate conference, BBC Politics East talked to agricultural students and their tutors at Easton College, near Norwich.
Student Rowan Venables, who also works as a potato technician, said she had serious concerns about global warming.
""I think is going to having an effect on the crops that we see coming out of the ground,"" she said.
""With my job, I'm definitely seeing more scabbing [a common disease of potatoes] because we are having more irregular rainfalls because of the different temperatures.
""And [with rising temperatures] we are also going to have to change the crops we grow or change the variety of the crops we grow, to varieties we are not used to.""
Ella Hinsley, from Suffolk, said: ""Climate change is going to have a big impact on agriculture and how we do things.
""There are things we can do to be sustainable, but there are limits to what can be done.
""Farmers need to do more about how much fuel they use on their farms. If we can use less fuel, and travel fewer miles, that would be good.""
Harvey Stewart, who lives in south Cambridgeshire, believes agriculture in the UK is already becoming more and more sustainable.
""I think we need to become more sustainable and there are incentives to become more sustainable,"" he said.
""We are going in the right direction and we need to help the environment.""
William Haire, head of estate at Easton College, said staff aimed to teach agricultural students about the importance of sustainable farming.
""They learn the fundamental things so they can get things right,"" he said.
""We teach students how to keep animals healthy and fit. That's the starting point.
""We look at the circumstance of each field. We are looking at if we need to plough it [which would increase the use of tractors, for example]. Or if we don't need to plough it this year, how else should we use it?
""We are also looking at the choice of crops to the soil type or what plants are needed to build soil structure.""

351,COP26,Roger Harrabin,"COP26 climate change summit: So far, so good-ish",2021-11-03,"Let's start with the bad news. Governments are far, far from achieving their goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C.
We've already got dangerous warming in the form of floods, record heatwaves and wildfires, with a rise of just 1.1C.
That's the natural world. But in the political world of COP26, things are looking a little brighter in the Glasgow sunshine.
Expectations for this conference were low, but seasoned COP observers have been pleasantly surprised by a slew of announcements which suggest the world is on an unstoppable path to a low-carbon future.
'My island home is threatened - we have no hill to run to'
What does net zero mean?
What's the climate impact of COP26 private jets?
""The mood of the conference is good,"" Pete Betts, the former EU lead negotiator on climate change told me.
""The trend towards a zero-carbon world is irreversible. The question is when we get there, and what the climate will be like by then.""
His relative optimism can be explained by some of announcements made at the summit so far:
Kat Kramer from Christian Aid, which campaigns on climate change, says the many announcements are a positive sign.
""The COP itself is a consensus process, so it's a lowest common denominator. What we're seeing is other initiatives bolted on to the COP - there's real momentum.""
So far so good, then. But there have been disappointments. 
It had been expected that China would improve its offer to peak emissions by 2030. At least a token gesture was anticipated, but it's brought nothing. 
The only consolation for the COP is that China usually over-delivers on its promises - unlike some others.
Take the US. Former President George W Bush withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol and Donald Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement. 
The election of a Republican governor in Virginia yesterday raises the spectre of Mr Trump's possible return, which would probably undo climate measures all over again.
Negotiators will now get down to the messy task of sorting out a rule book, so that nations can trust each other's carbon-cutting plans.
They'll be rowing about the lack of government finance for poor countries, and the need for more money to adapt to global heating. And they want ""loss and damage"" - code for compensation for harm done to them by the emissions of poor nations.
The Virginia news won't help trust - but there's a feeling that by the standards of many COPs, this has got off to a good start.

The former Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, told the BBCâs Christian Fraser that although a global carbon price would be the best option, carbon taxes would probably have to be related to a countryâs resources.
Measures could be put in place to stop so-called carbon leakage where companies relocated to countries with lower carbon prices, he said.

353,COP26,BBC News,Northampton school's eco-council aims to combat fast-fashion,2021-11-03,"A school event aimed at encouraging students to re-use clothes will help develop ""future changemakers"".
Northampton School for Girls held a Back On The Rack event to raise awareness of fast-fashion culture.
The school's eco-council leader, Ava, said producing and throwing away clothes was ""one the biggest contributors to climate change"".  
Head teacher Cristina Taboada-Naya said the project was ""incredibly important"" to pupils.
The event saw youngsters at the state secondary school donate their old clothes, which could then be bought by their peers.
Money raised at the event would be reinvested into eco-initiatives, both within the school and the surrounding community.
Ava told BBC Look East: ""Fast-fashion is the production of trendy clothes made at cheap prices to meet the customers' demands.
""A lot of the time they are made to hop on a trend and they go out of fashion really quickly.
""That means there is so much waste. It uses up a lot of natural resources.""
She said the idea behind the event was to ""combat fast-fashion and make our school community greener"".
Eco-council member, Aleena, said the project had inspired her to share clothes with her sister and pass on old clothes to other family members.
""I don't like buying so many clothes and never using them again,"" she said.
Ms Taboada-Naya said the schoolgirls had been ""really inspired by COP26"", but she added that ""the reality is we've got our future world leaders within our schools right now and I like to think, and I believe, we've got future changemakers in our schools"".
The school planned to run more Back On The Rack events in the future.

Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon made the announcement on Wednesday.
The funding will see Londonderry's entire urban fleet at Foyle Metro replaced with electric buses.
It will become one of the first cities in the UK and Ireland to have a fully zero-emission bus fleet when all the vehicles go into service in 2023, Ms Mallon said. 
The minister made the announcement during a virtual address to the United Nations COP26 Global Climate Conference in Glasgow at an event hosted by Translink.  
""I have an ambitious vision for a low carbon future and I am committed to delivering cleaner, greener, sustainable infrastructure,"" Ms Mallon said.
""Tackling the climate crisis is a priority for me and I am committed to building a better future where we make zero/low emission public transport accessible to communities across the north.""
The Department for Infrastructure (DfI) said they have previously allocated funding of almost Â£74m for the purchase of 145 zero and low emission buses for the Translink fleet.
Ms Mallon said the additional funding of Â£30m for the north west would ""herald a new cleaner and greener era in transport for the city"" and would ""make a positive impact on the climate emergency and help enhance air quality"". 
Foyle MP Colum Eastwood welcomed the announcement, saying ""the time for talking is over and now is the time for action"". 
Mr Eastwood said the fleet would help improve air quality and make a positive impact on the climate crisis.
""Now is time for all shoulders to the wheel to end the crisis facing our planet,"" the SDLP leader said. 
""These are the changes we need to see to help us tackle climate change and contribute to better health outcomes for all our population,"" the minister added.
Translink chief executive Chris Conway said: ""Today marks a further milestone in the journey to achieve our ambitious targets to make public transport carbon net zero by 2040 and go beyond to be climate positive by 2050.""
Mr Conway said Translink was delighted to make this announcement at COP26 and ""showcase the actions being taken to tackle the climate emergency"" and ""drive positive change for a healthier and more sustainable transport for future generations to come"".
""We will have over 100 zero-emission buses in passenger service next spring making up over a third of our Metro fleet,"" Mr Conway said.

356,COP26,Robert Plummer & Beth Timmins,COP26: UK firms forced to show how they will hit net zero,2021-11-03,"Most big UK firms and financial institutions will be forced to show how they intend to hit climate change targets, under proposed Treasury rules.
By 2023, they will have to set out detailed public plans for how they will move to a low-carbon future - in line with the UK's 2050 net-zero target.
An expert panel will set the standards the plans need to meet to ensure they are not just spin. 
Any commitments will not be mandatory. Green groups say this is not enough. 
Net zero is when a business or a country achieves an overall balance between the amount of carbon it is emitting and the carbon that it's removing from the atmosphere.
Firms and their shareholders will be left to decide how their businesses adapt to this transition, including how they intend to decarbonise.
And although the plans will need to be published, the government said ""the aim is to increase transparency and accountability"" and the UK was not ""making firm-level net-zero commitments mandatory"".
The market will decide whether firms' plans are credible, the Treasury said.
Speaking at the COP26 climate summit, Chancellor Rishi Sunak claimed the UK was leading the world in becoming the ""first-ever net zero aligned global financial centre"".
He said the changes would mean: ""Better and more consistent climate data; sovereign green bonds; mandatory sustainability disclosures; proper climate risk surveillance; and proper global reporting standards.""
In total, 450 firms controlling 40% of global financial assets - equivalent to $130tn (Â£95tn) - have agreed to commit to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.
However, campaign group Global Witness said that without regulation the pledges were ""doomed to fail"".
""Banks and financiers are the lifeblood of the fossil fuel companies and destructive agribusinesses fuelling the climate crisis - so it's right that focus should be on them at COP26. 
""However, today's announcement by banks risks amounting to more greenwashing if it's not legally binding,"" said Veronica Oakeshott, head of forests policy and advocacy at Global Witness.
David Barmes, senior economist at the campaign group Positive Money, said the intention was positive, but that financial firms were still ""pouring billions into environmentally harmful projects.""
Mark Campanale, founder and executive chair of Carbon Tracker Initiative, praised the ambition of the plans, but said details of how it would work were still unclear.
""None of the financial assets announced are currently aligned with net-zero and no group of companies can say they are meeting the Paris target by continuing to invest in fossil fuels, so that needs to change considerably before London can be lauded as the world's first net-zero financial centre and a model for the world,"" he said.
Shaun Spiers, executive director of environmental think tank Green Alliance, said that more UK public sector funding was needed. 
""Private sector investment is vital, but it will be much easier to achieve on the back of serious investment by the chancellor,"" he said.
However, a coalition of finance groups led by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney said there was enough finance committed to keep global warming to 1.5C.
The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) said more than $130trn (Â£95trn) of private capital ""is now committed to transforming the economy for net zero"".
In practice, this means that bank loans which would go to an oil field, or a coal mine, are diverted to renewable energy or to a mortgage product that subsidises highly efficient homes.
Bank bosses will also be expected to have tough conversations with their customers who want to build coal power stations, pulling funding in advanced nations now, and developing countries beyond the next decade. 
Under the proposed Treasury rules, financial institutions and companies with shares listed on the London Stock Exchange must come up with net-zero transition plans, which will be published from 2023.
The strategies will need to include targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and steps which firms intend to take to get there.
A taskforce made up of industry leaders, academics, regulators and civil society groups will set a science-based ""gold standard"" for the plans in order to guard against so-called ""greenwashing"" - where environmental initiatives are more about marketing than substance.
However, the government said there was ""not yet a commonly agreed standard for what a good quality transition plan looks like"".
Meanwhile, Mr Sunak also pledged that a target for developed countries to send $100bn (Â£720m) a year to those that are less developed - to help support their transition to net zero - will be achieved by 2023. 
Alison Rose, chief executive of Natwest, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the bank had started measuring the emissions on its balance sheet to help it track progress, saying ""transparency was critical"".
She said the bank was working with the oil and gas industry ""to develop credible transition plans so we can track progress and work with our customers"".
But Ms Rose said its main focus was helping small firms where there were ""real business opportunities"" in ""adopting sustainable supply chain [and] sustainable business practices"".
Kay Swinburne, vice-chairman of financial services at KPMG UK, said the announcement on UK firms would provide the financial services industry with a ""valuable set of unified metrics to measure progress towards decarbonisation"". 
""It is brave to put a gold standard in place for all companies raising funding,"" she added.  
And Dr Ben Caldecott, director of the UK Centre for Greening Finance and Investment, said the plans would ""spur demand for green finance and accelerate decarbonisation, not just in the UK but wherever UK firms do business"".
Follow the money to net zero. That is the plan unveiled today, with two-fifths of the world's financial assets, $130tn, under the management of banks, insurers and pension funds that have signed up to 2050 net-zero goals including limiting global warming to 1.5C.
This means that the giant laser beam of global finance will be fired towards technologies that lower and eradicate carbon emissions, and away from ""brown holdings"" of investments in coal, oil and gas. 
But can such fundamental ecological, economic and social change really be achieved more through financial carrot than by regulatory stick? This position suits politicians who don't necessarily want to tell their voting public to consume or travel less than they are used to. 
By changing the financial system, their hope is that the trajectory of every economic sector, from energy to transport, food to clothing, how we live, work and what we consume will decarbonise of their own accord.

357,COP26,Harriet Bradshaw,Is a new oil field climate change hypocrisy?,2021-11-03,"Glasgow is hosting the COP26 climate summit amid ongoing controversy over a new oil field west of Shetland that could get the green light by the UK government.
The Cambo oil field is thought to contain 800 million barrels of oil - with climate campaigners saying it would be hypocrisy to develop the site at a time when countries across the world are being asked to take urgent action to prevent global temperatures from spiralling out of control.  
The UK government's Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, has said that the new field should ""100%"" get the go-ahead, arguing that it would be ""foolish to think that we can just run away from oil and gas"". 
The Scottish government has been accused of sitting on the fence over whether or not the development should be allowed, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon refusing to openly oppose the plans.
The Cambo oil field is situated approximately 125km (75 miles) to the west of the Shetland Islands in water depths of between 1,050m to 1,100m. 
While the UK government says the original ""licensing approval"" for the site dates back to 2001, it is important to note that licence was an exploration licence. 
Before any oil or gas is discovered in a particular location, such a licence gives companies permission to seek out where it is. 
An industry expert has told me that there is then a lengthy, rigorous process - which can sometimes take decades - involving the creation of field development plans, environmental statements and many other requirements which require approval from the relevant bodies, before production activity can begin.
If approved by the Oil and Gas Authority, drilling at Cambo could start as early as 2022. And the field is expected to produce oil and gas for approximately 25 years. 
It is this ""licensing loophole"" that is also causing concern to campaigners. 
A spokesperson for the UK government's Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has responded to the criticisms, saying: ""While we are working hard to drive down demand for fossil fuels, there will continue to be ongoing demand for oil and gas over the coming years, as recognised by the independent Climate Change Committee."" 
The company behind the Cambo proposal is Siccar Point Energy, backed by private equity firm investors.
It sees this as an opportunity to create more than 1,000 jobs and even more in the supply chain.
""The Cambo development supports the country's energy transition, maintaining secure UK supply,"" says Jonathan Roger, the company's CEO. 
""We have proactively taken significant steps to minimise the emissions footprint through its design and Cambo will be built 'electrification-ready', with the potential to use onshore renewable power when it becomes available in the future, in line with decarbonisation targets.""
The other player is Shell, which has a 30% stake in the project. While a spokesperson told me they were unable to comment on the licence application because Shell is not the operator, they did tell me about the company's overall strategy.
They said: ""Even the most ambitious scenarios tell us that as the energy system transitions, the world will continue to need oil and gas for decades to come. 
""Targeted investment will generate cash to help fund the growth of our new low-carbon portfolio.""
But the group of campaigners protesting against the proposal do not believe this sticks, with Friends of the Earth gaining thousands of signatures on their petitions.
They calculate that in phase 1, emissions alone would be approximately the equivalent of the annual greenhouse gas emissions of 16 coal-fired power plants. 
They say this contradicts a number of robust targets and recommendations to keep rising temperatures in check, including the International Energy Agency recommendations for no new oil and gas fields from 2021, except those already approved.
""The huge response to the open letter shows that the public understand that we must keep fossil fuels in the ground and switch to clean renewable energy,"" says Friends of the Earth Scotland climate and energy campaigner Caroline Rance.
""Both the UK and Scottish governments must end their hypocritical support for drilling for every last drop of climate-wrecking oil and gas, and instead develop a clear plan for winding down fossil fuel extraction while retraining offshore workers and supporting communities affected by this transition.""

358,COP26,Hannah Mills,COP26: Olympian Hannah Mills wants athletes to tackle climate change,2021-11-03,"I'm at COP26, doing all I can to add my voice, and those of fellow Olympic athletes, to calls for immediate and radical action on climate change. 
Winning Olympic gold medals has given me a platform to talk about the issues that I care about. 
I would not have enjoyed that without my sporting success.
I can imagine some readers rolling their eyes and asking what right I have to lecture them about the environment just because I can sail a boat?
It's a fair challenge, but not one I shy away from.
Sport is hugely influential in the UK, and around the world.
It has the power to influence behaviour and decision-making way beyond the confines of a sports' stadium or major championship. 
Hundreds of millions of fans hang on every word from their sporting icons.  
Their posts on social media influence people's choices on subjects as diverse as which team people to support, what clothes to wear or which brands to buy. 
Remember what happened when footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, a man with 332 million Instagram followers, swapped a bottle of sponsored fizzy drink for some water during a European Championship press conference? 
It created a public debate about whether certain brands are appropriate sponsors for sporting events. 
That tiny gesture by Ronaldo was so powerful, it made millions of consumers think about what they kept in their fridges. 
And last year, Manchester United and England footballer Marcus Rashford made the UK government think again about their policy on child food poverty.
Politicians, by themselves, had not been persuasive enough to make the government change its mind. 
But Rashford's real-life experience and massive public profile shifted the debate. 
So was it right for Rashford, a man whose fame comes from goal-scoring not politics, to intervene? 
The 1.3 million children who were able to claim free school meal vouchers during the summer holidays would certainly say ""yes"".  
Athletes have a powerful opportunity to do good, thanks to the profile that sport has given them. 
So I urge my fellow athletes to seize that opportunity with the same determination that brought them sporting glory. 
Especially when it comes to the future of our fragile planet. 
The climate crisis is urgent.  
That's why I am unashamedly using my modest platform to urge world leaders not to shirk the big decisions on climate change and plastic pollution as they meet in Glasgow.  
It is the right thing to do. 
It can be quite frightening as an athlete to put your head above the parapet and speak out about environmental issues. 
The charge of hypocrisy is never far away. 
I am the first to admit that my sport, sailing, has a large carbon footprint. 
To race, we fly ourselves and our equipment round the world in planes that guzzle fossil fuels and spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. 
Sometimes, on our travels, it is impossible to avoid buying food wrapped in single use plastic, even though I campaign passionately about plastic pollution.
I am not perfect. In that sense, I am a hypocrite. That's the point. We all are. 
But whenever I can, I make conscious choices about what to eat or how to travel. I do the best I can. 
If we can all make better choices on the small things and put pressure on governments and businesses to make changes with the biggest impact, it will add up to something worthwhile. 
On a recent trip back home to Wales, I visited Uplands Rugby Club in Swansea which has decided to cut out single-use plastic. 
The chairman Peter Evans explained that the change had not been that difficult although, at times, it had made things more complicated. 
I asked why they had done it. 
He replied that it was all about the club's values and developing rounded young people. 
Junior rugby players at Uplands are being taught about the benefits of teamwork, graft and fair play, but also that protecting the environment is a great way to serve the community they represent. 
I was really touched by that idea.  
Caring for the environment is a true sporting value. 
It is the right thing to do. 
And that's why everyone in sport, from global megastars to the youngest fan, should make their voices heard with whatever platform they have before it's too late.

359,COP26,BBC News,COP26: Low-carbon firms and Biden hails progress,2021-11-03,"Here are five things you need to know about the COP26 climate change conference on Wednesday.
Today is finance day at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow and Chancellor Rishi Sunak is due to set out plans to encourage large firms to work towards the UK's 2050 net-zero target. Under new Treasury rules most big UK firms and financial institutions will be forced to publish details, by 2023, of how they will move to low-carbon emissions. Though not mandatory, the government said the aim is to increase transparency and accountability. However, green groups say the proposals do not go far enough. This announcement comes as deals such as cutting methane emissions and boosting green technologies were agreed on Tuesday. To keep up-to-day with what's happening to today, follow our updates.
The vast majority of world leaders viewed COP26 as an opportunity to ""press the restart button"", US President Joe Biden said, hailing the progress of the conference as he left. His visit ended following the conclusion of the world leaders summit, which kickstarted the conference. He left Edinburgh Airport in Air Force One after saying: ""We showed up... and by showing up we've had a profound impact on how the rest of the world is looking at the United States and its leadership role."" He added that the absence of the Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the summit was a ""big mistake"".
To help end its reliance on coal, South Africa is set to receive $8.5bn (Â£6.2bn) from wealthier nations in what President Cyril Ramaphosa says is a ""watershed moment"". The deal could have global and local implications as the country is a major emitter of greenhouse gases, which cause the planet's temperature to rise. South Africa uses coal to generate electricity.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands - a sprawling nation of more than 1,200 low-lying atolls and isles in the Pacific Ocean - are only 2m above sea level. Sea level rise caused by climate change means it is one of the most threatened countries in the world, says poet and activist Kathy JetnÌil-Kijiner, adding that unlike other island nations, there are no mountains and there's no higher ground to go to. She's a climate envoy at COP26 and she told us how it feels to fight for her country's very existence.

360,Climate change,BBC News,UK's 'longest-lasting' snow patch melts away,2021-11-03,"What is historically the UK's longest lasting patch of snow has disappeared for ""only the eighth time in 300 years"".
Dubbed the Sphinx, the patch on remote Braeriach in the Cairngorms has melted away more frequently in the last 18 years.
Snow patch expert Iain Cameron said climate change was a likely factor.
According to records, the Sphinx previously melted fully in 1933, 1959, 1996, 2003, 2006, 2017 and 2018.
Before 1933, it is thought to have last melted completely in the 1700s.
The Sphinx had shrunk to the size of an A4 piece of paper in recent weeks before finally disappearing in mild weather.
Stirling-based Mr Cameron has been studying snow patches in Scotland for 25 years and is author of the book The Vanishing Ice, which he describes as a ""lament"" to snow and ice that lingers high in Scotland's hills.
He worked alongside the late Dr Adam Watson, a biologist dubbed Mr Cairngorms because of his many years studying the mountains.
Some of Dr Watson's research on the Sphinx drew on information handed down by generations of people who worked and visited the Cairngorms, which suggests the patch may have only melted a few times in the last 300 years.
From the 1840s the Scottish Mountaineering Club began noting the fortunes of the patch, and more recently scientists and ecologists have gathered information. 
Mr Cameron told BBC Scotland that historically the Sphinx was the UK's ""most durable"" snow patch.
But he said: ""That is being challenged because it is disappearing more often.""
This video can not be played
Mr Cameron said warmer weather due to climate change ""seemed to be the logical"" explanation for the increased rate of melting.
He added that the conditions were affecting snowy areas high on other Scottish mountains including in the Ben Nevis range in Lochaber.
Aonach Beag, near Ben Nevis, also has a patch of snow that has often survived from one winter to another.
But Mr Cameron said: ""What we are seeing from research are smaller and fewer patches of snow.
""Less snow is falling now in winter than in the 1980s and even the 1990s.""
Separately from Mr Cameron's research, a report commissioned by Cairngorms National Park Authority and published last year said declining snow cover, and fewer days when it snowed had been observed on Cairngorm mountain since the winter of 1983-84.
Researchers also noted a trend for increasingly warmer weather since the 1960s, and suggested that by the 2080s there would be some years with very little or no snow at all on Cairngorm.
Lauren McCallum, of international climate change campaign group Protect Our Winters, said the Cairngorms - and wider world - needed to be protected from further rises in temperature.
She said: ""We have to maintain a healthy temperature for our ecosystems and communities to survive.""
The Sphinx lies in Garbh Choire Mor, a hollow known as a corrie formed by ice or a glacier during the last ice age, on 1,296m (4,252ft) Braeriach - Britain's third highest mountain.
Garbh Choire Mor is described as Scotland's snowiest corrie because of the amount of snow it can hold even through summer months.
The Sphinx is the name of a climbing route near the snow patch.
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

To keep the world safe, scientists say that global heating has to be limited to 1.5C by the end of this century.

This causes a problem for oil and gas producers around the world but also for how countries function.
""I guess we have an addiction to oil and gas in our society,"" Deirdre Michie, the chief executive of Oil and Gas UK, tells the BBC documentary Black Black Oil.
""Just to stop it for the sake of stopping it is not going to stop the demand that is associated with it,"" she says.
Climate activists say the failure to act quickly enough to move away from fossil fuels is allowing the oil firms to carry on, making the climate emergency more difficult to tackle.
Young Scottish activist Holly Gillibrand says: ""I think people will look back at this era of oil and think about how ridiculous it was.
""We know the climate and ecological crisis is happening, we know how bad it could get. How could you worry about such a massive issue and still worry more about profit?""
In the documentary, James Marriot, the author of Crude Britannia, explains how speculative North Sea exploration in the late 1960s became a gold rush after BP found oil in the massive Forties field, 100 miles off to the north east of Aberdeen.
The first North Sea oil came ashore in June 1975 and is thought to have peaked in 1999, with about 45 billion barrels extracted so far.
Although the oil and gas is now tougher to extract, the reserves are substantial, with another 20 to 30 years of production thought to be possible.
The Cambo oil field, west of Shetland, which contains more than 800 million barrels of oil, has proved particularly controversial.
If approved by the Oil and Gas Authority, drilling at the Cambo field could start as early as 2022 and last 25 years.
Holly Gillibrand, who was inspired by the school strikes of Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, tells the documentary: ""If the politicians are saying that they're tackling the climate ecological crisis and taking it seriously and then extracting more North Sea oil, then that's just making this problem deeper. 
""You can't fill in a hole unless you stop digging, and we really need to stop digging.""
Jake Molloy, regional organiser of the RMT Union, who has worked in the industry for decades, says: ""Even if we shut the North Sea down tomorrow, we are still going to be reliant on oil and gas and we are going to be importing it for years to come because 80% of domestic heating is currently natural gas. 
""To my mind, rather than shutting the North Sea down we should exploit it as part of the transition.""
Emeka Emembolu, senior vice-president of BP North Sea, describes that transition away from decades of reliance on hydrocarbons for transport, heating and manufacturing as ""almost like replacing all the veins in the human body"".
But he says his company is trying to make the shift.
BP was a major player from the beginning of North Sea exploration and until quite recently operated 22 fields. It is now down to just six.
Mr Emembolu says: ""We will maintain some level of oil and gas production over time but we are hugely ramping up our investments in non-oil and gas forms of energy as well.""
He says BP is getting involved in the ScotWind leasing process with an aim to build offshore wind farms but the process from acquiring the lease to installing the turbines can be as long as 10 years.
""We will do everything we can to compress that period and make it faster but what we're talking about is changing the infrastructure of the world,"" he says. ""That takes time.""
Shell is another major player in the North Sea which has taken a step back. 
It owns 30% of the controversial Cambo development it but it is not the operator.
The company behind the Cambo proposal is Siccar Point Energy, backed by private equity firm investors.
The most active driller in the North Sea is now a company called Harbour Energy.
Its chief executive Phil Kirk says it bought a big chunk of Shell in what was a ""transformative deal"".
Oil workers' union representative Jake Molloy suggests the investment houses behind such deals may soon themselves feel the pressure of being exposed and attacked for continuing to invest in oil and gas and ""pull the plug"".
""Oil and gas workers now are very nervous about what the future holds for them,"" he says.
Steve Waygood, chief responsible investor at Aviva Investors, agrees that ethical investment plays a role in the future of oil and gas although until now markets have been quite ""amoral"" and only concerned with return on equity.
He says oil has seen a huge decline in its returns over the past decade whereas solar and wind have improved dramatically.
Mr Waygood says the London Stock Exchange is one of the worst exchanges in the world in terms of exposure to large oil companies listed on it.
""People's pensions, savings and investments are actually invested in financing a future that no-one wants to see but no-one really realises,"" he says.
""We own companies that are undermining what we wish to bequeath to our children.""
Climate lawyer Tessa Khan says that is why we have to move to solar and wind now.
She says: ""To continue to lock in our dependency on oil and gas because we think that in 30 years time we might still need it is a huge mistake and it is missing an opportunity to be at the forefront of this energy revolution.""

The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

362,Climate change,BBC News,Newcastle free parking could be cut to discourage car use,2021-11-03,"Free evening parking in Newcastle city centre could be cut to discourage car use, a council has said.
Since the launch of the Alive After Five scheme in 2010, parking at seven sites has been free after 17:00 to boost evening trade.
But now the council says it is reviewing the plan as it aims to launch a Clean Air Zone (CAZ).
Council leader Nick Forbes said the authority needed to be ""consistent"" on discouraging car use.
Alive After Five runs in seven council-owned car parks - Eldon Square, Eldon Garden, Dean Street, Quayside Multi-Storey, Oxford Street, Manors, and Grainger Town Multi-Storey.
Introduced alongside later opening hours for city centre businesses, the scheme has been credited with boosting the area's economy by hundreds of millions of pounds since its inception, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
But the city is also wanting to bring down emissions levels which are linked to more than 300 premature deaths on Tyneside each year.
Mr Forbes said poor air quality was caused largely by rush-hour rather than evening traffic, but added: ""There is a wider issue about making sure we are consistent in encouraging people to use public transport wherever possible and that there are not perverse incentives for people to drive unnecessarily.
""We are reviewing Alive After Five as part of our normal budget processes and are looking long term at how we balance the different competing interests to make sure we support the economy but at the same time ensure that public transport and walking and cycling is prioritised above car usage wherever possible.""
Stephen Patterson, chief executive of city centre business improvement district company NE1 Ltd, said he understood the changes would only apply to those council-run multi-storeys within the new CAZ, which is due to launch in 2022 with daily fees for some high-polluting vehicles, though not private cars, coming into the city centre.
The city council refused to confirm any details of which car parks would be affected or when the change might happen, but a spokesman said any changes would be ""subject to consultation"".

370,COP26,sal Islam,COP26: Changing the plumbing of the financial system,2021-11-02,"Follow the money to net zero. That is the plan unveiled today, with two-fifths of the world's financial assets, $130 trillion, under the management of banks, insurers and pension funds that have signed up to 2050 net-zero goals including limiting global warming to 1.5C.
This means that the giant laser beam of global finance will be fired towards technologies that lower and eradicate carbon emissions, and away from ""brown holdings"" of investments in coal, oil and gas. 
The aim of the initiative chaired by former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney is to change the plumbing of the whole financial system forever.
What does this mean in practice?
Essentially the easy cheap bank financing that naturally flows to, say, an oil field, or a coal mine, is diverted to renewable energy or to a mortgage product that subsidises highly efficient homes. 
In fact all of this is already happening in niches, with loans raised for environmental investments attracting a flood of money, and so cheaper funding - something referred to as a ""greenium"".
Bank chiefs say they are having tough conversations with their customers who want to build coal power stations, pulling funding in advanced nations now, and developing countries beyond the next decade. So that is the grand hope. 
Promisingly, the Chinese, whose public banks have been huge backers of coal around the world, have also said they will step back from such investments. 
But the negotiations in Glasgow will fall short of setting a global carbon price - the sort of measure that could really guarantee the path to net zero. 
They have also so far not come up with a globally consistent way for bank regulators to force the financial system to increase the risk and the cost of lending to carbon intensive industry. 
And then there is the really fundamental question about COP26's climate finance agenda: can such fundamental ecological, economic and social change really be achieved more through financial carrot than by regulatory stick? 
This position suits politicians who don't necessarily want to tell their voting public to consume or travel less than they are used to. 
By changing the financial system, their hope is that the trajectory of every economic sector, from energy to transport, food to clothing, how we live, work and what we consume will decarbonise of their own accord.

371,COP26,BBC News,COP26: Biden attacks China and Russia leaders for missing summit,2021-11-02,"US President Joe Biden has criticised the leaders of China and Russia for not turning up to the COP26 climate summit. 
In a speech on Tuesday night, Mr Biden said climate was ""a gigantic issue"" and China ""walked away"" - adding it was the ""same thing with Russia and Putin"".
Neither Russian President Vladimir Putin nor Chinese leader Xi Jinping are at the summit in Glasgow. 
Both countries however have sent delegations to the talks, which are due to run for two weeks until 14 November.
China is the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, followed by the US. Russia is the fifth largest after the EU and India. 
More than 120 leaders turned up at the conference in Scotland's largest city. 
Countries have already announced major deals, including a global pledge to slash methane levels by 2030 as well as to end and reverse deforestation by the same year. 
Both China and Russia are signatories of the pledge to reverse deforestation. Before Mr Biden's speech, Mr Putin virtually addressed a meeting on forest management at the COP26 summit on Tuesday, saying that Russia takes the ""strongest and most vigorous measures to conserve"" woodlands, according to a Kremlin press release.
The US president made his comments when asked about the role that other countries - including China, Russia and Saudi Arabia - had played in talks so far. 
""The fact that China is trying to assert, understandably, a new role in the world as a world leader - not showing up, come on,"" Mr Biden said, adding that Xi Jinping's absence was a ""big mistake"".
He said the same about Mr Putin, saying that Russia's wilderness was burning and their president ""stays mum"" about the issue. 
Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov gave no reason why the Russian leader would not attend when they announced the decision in October, although he said climate change was an ""important"" priority for Russia. 
The same month officials warned UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson that China's President Xi Jinping was not expected to attend. It is thought that President Xi has not left China since early 2020.
In September Mr Xi announced China will aim for carbon neutrality by 2060, with a plan to hit peak emissions before 2030.
President Putin said Russia would also strive to reach carbon neutrality ""no later than 2060"" in an international energy forum speech on 13 October. 
Net zero, or becoming carbon neutral, means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

The group sat down on St Vincent Street in a peaceful protest but after negotiations about 100 were then accompanied by police towards the Clyde Arc bridge. 
The road closure meant some traffic was blocked from accessing the motorway.
A spokeswoman from Scottish Power said: ""We're aware of the peaceful protest in Glasgow city centre, which was paused outside our HQ while the a route for the protestors to the COP venue was identified. 
""The protest was not directed at Scottish Power.""

374,COP26,Jonathan Josephs,Shipping boss: 'Christmas will be safe' from shortages,2021-11-02,"Christmas trading will be safe from supply chain problems, the boss of shipping firm Maersk has told the BBC - adding, ""at least that's what I'm hearing from our customers"".
The company handles almost 20% of the world's shipping containers.
Chief executive Soren Skou, said the firm is chartering more ships, keeping ports open longer and has opened more warehouses to help.
The firm is doing ""everything"" it can to alleviate the problems, he said. 
There have been recent warnings in the UK and the US that logjams at ports will lead to shortages at Christmas.
Mr Skou said that a shortage of workers in the ports to unload ships and a lack of truckers was behind the problems. 
A Road Haulage Association (RHA) survey of its members estimates there is now a shortage of more than 100,000 qualified drivers in the UK. That number includes thousands of drivers from European Union (EU) member states who were previously living and working in the UK. There are also shortages across Europe and the US.
Mr Skou estimated that approximately 300 large container ships around the world are sitting waiting outside ports. Almost 80 of these, he added, were in Los Angeles, with a ""few"" outside Felixstowe and others stuck by Chinese ports including Shanghai and Ningbo.
This widespread congestion was triggered by a collapse in demand during the early stages of the pandemic. That was followed by a period of frantic activity, as people who were forced to stay at home rather than travel or socialise, ordered large quantities of consumer goods.
Mr Skou, who runs the world's biggest shipping firm, said this shows no sign of easing: ""The reality is that consumer demand is strong and at the same time our customers inventories are low.""
""They both need to serve the consumer here and now, but also rebuild inventories and that's why we have an unprecedented demand situation"".
The demand has meant Maersk and other shipping companies have been able to charge record prices. The Danish company's pre-tax profits rose fivefold to $5.9bn for the July to September period.
Last week Japanese cargo line Ocean Network Express reported a more than eight fold jump in profits for the same period, to $4.2bn. 
One of UK's biggest toy retailers, The Entertainer, recently warned delays at UK ports will result in shortages this Christmas. 
In the US, the port of Los Angeles has started operating 24 hours a day to clear a backlog of cargo ships which has led to shortages. White House officials warned that there ""will be things that people can't get"" during the holiday season, despite President Biden appointing a bottlenecks Czar. 
Simon Heaney of the maritime research firm Drewry, said Maersk's mitigations might not be enough. Mr Heaney explained that ""port congestion is worsening while the number of ships waiting outside major ports around the world is increasing"".
The brief closure of some big container terminals due to China's coronavirus restrictions, extreme weather events and a rise in the Delta variant of coronavirus, are each playing a part Mr Heaney said. 
Mr Heaney added that opening ports for longer won't help if there aren't enough staff to run them.
90% of global trade is moved by sea and with demand having shown no sign of easing, the shipping industry is looking to tackle its impact on climate change.
It's responsible for about 2% of carbon emissions, meaning that if the industry was a country it would be the sixth biggest polluter, above Germany.
The UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is aiming for a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 compared to 2008 levels.
As world leaders meet to tackle climate change in Glasgow Mr Skou was critical of the targets set by the UN body that oversees his industry: ""The ambition level at the IMO so far has been quite limited"". 
""We as Maersk certainly are pushing hard for that to be reducing by 100% in 2050 and we believe it can be done"".
On Monday at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said: ""We urge the IMO to take action to set ambitious targets to achieve zero emission shipping by 2050"". 
""Carbon-neutral shipping is vital to reaching our climate goals,"" he added. Shipping was not included in the Paris climate agreement.
The International Chamber of Shipping has backed a $5bn fund to develop carbon free shipping and overcome a lack of investment in the technology required. Maersk plans to launch the world's first carbon neutral cargo ship in 2023.
However, Mr Skou said the slow progress doesn't mean we need to move fewer goods around the world to tackle climate change. 
""I think we just have to get to the point that we can use different fuels,"" he added.

""I've seen more energy and more commitment and more urgency than I've ever seen and I've been doing this since 1988,"" US climate envoy John Kerry said.
But there is some way to go if leaders are to get an agreement that would keep alive the prospect set out in the Paris Agreement of restricting global temperature rises to 1.5C, according to the prime minister. 
China is said to be one of those pushing back against a focus on limiting warming to 1.5C.
Mr Johnson told a news conference ""one thing that gives me optimism - for the countries who find it most difficult to transition from fossil fuels, we're starting to form those coalitions to help them"". 
But he added that ""if we don't fix our climate, it will be an economic catastrophe as well as a environmental catastrophe"".

He said the public ""may not listen to me, but they certainly listen to Sir David Attenborough (who spoke at the summit on Monday) and they look at what's actually happening around the world"", referring to natural disasters in recent years.
Ahead of the summit, hosted by the UK, he had compared the fight against further climate change to a football match - suggesting humanity was 5-1 down at half-time. 
With the world already experiencing dangerous heating, it's vital for this conference to produce more than what the activist Greta Thunberg calls ""blah blah blah"". 
Today world leaders have announced initiatives of some significance.
In one declaration, more than 100 countries promised to reverse deforestation by 2030. The pledge includes almost Â£14bn ($19.2bn) of public and private funds.
Another major announcement is a pact to cut emissions of methane by 30% by 2030.
The third eye-catching action was an agreement between 40 nations, including the UK, China, India and the US, to work together to create standards and incentives for new technologies.
And in a fourth announcement, the governments of France, Germany, the UK, the US, and the EU, have outlined a partnership to get South Africa off coal, with an initial funding of Â£6bn ($8.5bn).
These actions together won't solve the climate problem. But they do demonstrate some valuable new thinking. 
The prime minister said: ""We've pulled back a goal, or perhaps even two, and I think we are going to be able to take this thing to extra-time, because there's no doubt that some progress has been made.""
Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband responded by saying: ""The score that really matters is whether we cut carbon emissions by half this decade.""
Mr Johnson also said that while the ""doomsday clock was still ticking"" - having previously said it is at a minute to midnight - there was now a bomb disposal team on site and ""they're starting to snip the wires - I hope some of the right wires"".
As he prepared to return to London, Mr Johnson told the teams remaining in Glasgow: ""The eyes of the world are on you - the eyes of the British government and all the other governments that care about this - and we have got your numbers."" 
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

378,COP26,BBC News,Corby: Zero carbon timber eco-home showcased at COP26,2021-11-02,"A timber-built eco-house which is both energy and carbon efficient from the day building starts is being showcased at the COP26 summit.
The project is championed by modern homes specialists SNRG and energy efficiency company, Electric Corby.
One of the timber homes was displayed at the Construction Scotland Innovation Centre in Glasgow.
SNRG development director Nick Bolton said the aim was to ""demonstrate the art of the possible"".
Mr Bolton, who is also co-founder of Electric Corby, said the homes would be built in a factory out of ""sustainable locally-grown timber"".
The idea came out of work being done by Electric Corby, which first came to prominence when it developed the town's electric vehicle charge point infrastructure in 2011.
The company has been developing zero-energy homes at Priors Hall Park in Corby since 2013.
Mr Bolton said when SNRG visited the project they were keen to roll it out across the UK, using timber homes for carbon efficiency.
Traditional homes, even eco-friendly, energy efficient ones, involve the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere via the production of concrete, cement and steel when they are being built.
Mr Bolton said: ""Straight away you have got 10, maybe 20 years' worth of energy efficiency to achieve before you pay back all that carbon.
""Whereas if you build a timber home you are starting from a clean sheet.
""We are really hoping to demonstrate the art of the possible, how we can achieve low-embedded carbon in our developments, as well as energy efficiency once built.""
He added that for every tree used to develop a home, the aim would be to grow two more with plans also in place to regrow areas of Rockingham Forest in Northamptonshire to ""get that central belt forest re-established"".

379,COP26,Vumani Mkhize,COP26: South Africa hails deal to end reliance on coal,2021-11-02,"South Africa is set to receive $8.5bn (Â£6.2bn) to help end its reliance on coal in a deal announced at the COP26 climate summit.
President Cyril Ramaphosa has called it a ""watershed moment"".
The country is currently a major emitter of greenhouse gases as a result of its addiction to coal, which it uses to generate electricity.
This deal, funded by wealthier nations, could have both global and local implications.
The vast scale of the coal operation run by the country's state power company Eskom makes South Africa the 12th biggest carbon dioxide emitter in the world, according to the Global Carbon Atlas.
Some of those at the heart of South Africa's coal country hope that the latest deal could ease the environmental and health impacts of the power sector.
Last month, driving into Emalahleni in Mpumalanga province, I saw a thick layer of smog hanging over the town. It stretched for kilometres, a dusty putrid haze that I could smell while still in the car. 
During winter the occasional stench of sulphur even reaches the country's commercial hub Johannesburg, which is more than 100km (62 miles) away. 
Emalahleni means ""The Place of Coals"" in the isiZulu language, and the town is where most of the country's coal is mined. 
It supplies a vast network of 12 power stations that dot the countryside of this inland province.
Even more alarming for the people of this province, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, is that South Africa is the world's biggest emitter of sulphur dioxide.
Many there suffer from a host of breathing problems caused by the extreme proximity to the mines and the power stations. 
Young mother of two Mbali Mathebula lives in Vosman, an Emalahleni township that sits opposite a coal mine. 
She has had to quit her job to look after her children. Her eldest has severe asthma and does not go to school during the bitterly cold winter months. 
""His life isn't the same as other kids. Because even when he plays, he only goes out for a short time then he has to rest,"" Ms Mathebula said.
""We have told the mines that there are houses where people are sick. They say they will come but they never do.""
Environmental activist Promise Mabilo added that people's homes are damaged as well. ""When they blast sometimes the bricks and debris fall on top of these houses,"" she said.
Local government official Erald Nkabinde blames the national authorities for allowing mines to operate so close to people's homes. 
He argued that the Department of Mineral Resources allows them to be opened without consultation with the people on the ground.
""Some of these environmental authorisation applications don't come to us, then the following day you wake up and find a mine right inside a settlement at the door step of a shack or a house,"" he told the BBC.
But, on a national level, while there is a recognition of the need to end the reliance on coal, South Africa is desperate for the electricity it produces.
Currently, 80% of its power comes from coal but what it generates is still not enough to satisfy demand.
For more than a decade, South Africa has experienced periods of planned blackouts, intended to ease the pressure on the electricity grid.
The power problems have stifled economic growth in a country beset by high unemployment.
Nevertheless, even before the deal was announced at the summit in Glasgow, the government had planned to shrink coal's contribution to the energy mix to less than 60% by 2030.
Wind and solar power were expected to provide 25% by that point.
With the money pledged by the US, UK, France, Germany and the EU, South Africa could now move much faster.
""It is proof that we can take ambitious climate action while increasing our energy security, creating jobs and harnessing new opportunities for investment, with support from developed economies,"" President Ramaphosa said.
But like leaders elsewhere in the world who are promising new green jobs, the president is faced by powerful groups worried about their economic future if the country turns away from coal.
The mines in Mpumalanga may cause environmental problems but they provide vital jobs.
The metal workers' union cites research saying that 100,000 jobs in mining and the associated industries could be at stake.
""No social plans, as far as we know, have been developed to assist all those communities who are going to be affected by that,"" National Union of Metal Workers spokesman Phakamile Hlubi told the BBC.
""If you're not going to replace those jobs with something, you're going to turn that entire province into a ghost town.""
This sentiment may have been at the heart of what was before COP26 seen as a slow approach taken by some in government.
Mining Minister Gwede Mantashe favoured a gradual change, urging people not to be ""emotional"" about demanding transition.
But now the 2050 deadline to close most of the country's coal plants can be brought forward.
When I called her up in Emalahleni, activist Ms Mabilo was excited to hear the news from Glasgow.
But she sounded a word of caution, saying local people now needed to be consulted.
""As communities, as environmental activists, we need to be part and parcel of the whole process so that we can all benefit from the transition,"" she said.
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

380,COP26,BBC News,My day at COP26: 'My island home is threatened - we have no hill to run to',2021-11-02,"Kathy JetnÌil-Kijiner, a poet and activist, is at COP26 as a climate envoy for the Republic of the Marshall Islands - a sprawling nation of more than 1,200 low-lying atolls and islands in the Pacific Ocean. In the latest in a series of first-person accounts from the Glasgow summit, she describes how it feels to fight for her country's very existence.
It's quite hard to really convey exactly what it looks like on the ground - the magnitude of the work and the exhausting running from meeting to meeting.
We had an 08:00 meeting with the President of Palau - another island country in the western Pacific. But there were very long lines to get inside COP.
I think that must be especially hard for those who might have physical disabilities. It's already quite difficult mentally to get through all of the work we're doing - the sheer magnitude of it.
The Marshall Islands are only 2m above sea level and we are one of the most threatened countries in the world - due to the sea level rise caused by climate change. Unlike other island nations, we have no mountains and there's no higher ground to go to.
But the summit is set up in a way that lets every country have a seat at the table and my nation has been a key player for years now. That's despite the size of our economy, or the physical remoteness of our islands. Since COP21, in Paris in 2015, we've been making a lot of strides. 
Within our team in Glasgow, I'm following the loss and damage negotiations (the idea that compensation should be paid to vulnerable states for climate-related events to which they cannot adapt). 
It's pretty in-depth and involves constant meetings throughout the day to discuss the language in the treaty that was signed after Paris. Our role is to make sure the needs of our nations aren't lost in technical language and aren't being subsumed by other agendas from larger countries. We negotiate every single line - even the smallest words. 
As a poet, all this definitely requires a shift in thinking. But poetry teaches us that words have power and meaning - and that's exactly what's happening here. We're looking at documents that have huge implications for the survival of our country and whether we'll get the assistance needed.
There was also a meeting between heads of state and representatives from countries in the High Ambition Coalition, which is trying to make sure this doesn't end as a blah, blah, blah, COP - like climate activist Greta Thunberg has warned.
My Day at COP26:
I think when you know why you're here, what your ultimate goal is and what you're fighting for, it helps you maintain your momentum and balance as you deal with these complicated issues, which are so physically taxing. Some discussions are emotionally draining too - for example, when you have to negotiate with countries that you know aren't taking your survival into account. 
That's what it's like being here. It's just trying to stay afloat, keep the momentum going and keep moving forward through the day.
As told to Jon Kelly
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

381,COP26,BBC News,Llanbedr bypass: Gwynedd accused of 'running away' from climate action,2021-11-02,"A row over a scrapped road bypass has deepened after a Welsh government minister accused Gwynedd council of ""running away"" from taking action on climate change.
Labour's deputy climate change minister, Lee Waters axed the Llanbedr bypass on Monday.
Plaid Cymru Gwynedd leader Dyfrig Siencyn said he was sacrificing rural areas ""on the altar of climate change"".
Mr Waters said the councillor had failed to show leadership on the issue.
The one-mile (1.5km) Llanbedr Access Road was given the go-ahead in March, with Welsh government backing worth Â£10m.
It had been hoped the road would open up access to a nearby airfield and help boost investment, and reduce pollution in Llanbedr.
The decision is part of an ongoing review of Welsh government road projects, and came after a panel concluded the road was likely to increase carbon emissions.
It prompted an angry response from local Plaid Cymru politicians.
Mr Siencyn said he was ""furious"" and added: ""It is clear that once again rural areas can be sacrificed on the altar of climate change where the real problem and the answers lie in our urban areas.""
At a Welsh government press conference on Tuesday Mr Waters said he understood Mr Siencyn was disappointed, but said: ""I think his comments are not right.""
He said Gwynedd had, like the Senedd, declared a climate emergency.
""It's no good leaders and decision makers signing up to the principle of taking action on climate change, and then when it comes to the actions necessary to follow that through, running away and saying alarming things.
""That just is not leadership that the the scale of our times requires us to make.""
He said the money that the Welsh government had committed to spend on the bypass remained on the table: ""We want to work with them to look at other solutions to tackle the congestion that they have some times of the year in Llanbedr.""
Many new road schemes are effectively frozen in Wales at present while the Welsh government conducts its review.
Mr Waters said Llanbedr bypass had been fast-tracked on the request of Gwynedd council - the whole process will take a year.
He said it will not only look at the Welsh government's road projects, but also ""when in the future new roads are the right solution and there will be times when they are the right solution"".
""There will be times when they are the right solution, but we [are] increasing the bar, the test that has to be met, for the solution to be recommended.""
Mr Siencyn said in response: ""Gwynedd fully stands by its climate and environmental responsibilities, together with our responsibilities for infrastructure, the economy and local communities.
""Llanbedr has waited nearly 70 years for investment to the road network in Ardudwy - we will, therefore, continue to press the Welsh government to review this decision.""
The row comes as COP26 takes place in Glasgow.
Welcoming the first major deal of the conference - to prevent deforestation overseas - First Minister Mark Drakeford admitted that Wales faced its own tree-planting ""challenge"".
Targets have repeatedly been missed in recent years - the Welsh government now considers its National Forest proposal as one of its flagship policies.
Treeplanting projects overseas have also been supported as part of a Welsh scheme that plants a tree in Uganda for every child born in Wales.
""I'll be meeting the president of Liberia later today and part of our agenda is to see whether we can do more to support that government in the tree planting efforts they wish to make,"" Mr Drakeford said.
Mr Waters also announced Â£150m to retrofit social homes with new technologies and insulation to curb Wales' emissions.
He said it would help ""thousands more families be warm in their homes"".
Research quoted in an Welsh government independent review in 2019 suggested the cost of retrofitting Wales' social and fuel poor homes would be much higher, between Â£500m and Â£1bn a year for ten years.

The Hollywood star, who is a UN climate change representative, was seen at the Kew Carbon Garden exhibit on Tuesday at the main conference centre.
He was mobbed by journalists, fans and delegates as he entered the building.
The Titanic star also took part in a fringe event on Monday, posing with film producer Paul Goodenough, founder of charity Rewriting Extinction.
Glaswegians expressed mock surprise at sightings of the Hollywood superstar and other famous faces, with one local tweeting: ""President of the USA outside Greggs and Leonardo DiCaprio in Maryhill. What is this alternative reality Glasgow is living in at the moment?""
The COP26 summit is being attended by leaders from around the world, with 200 countries being asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. 
DiCaprio has donated millions to environmental organisations and backed ventures such as those producing trainers made from natural materials.
He also described campaigner Greta Thunberg as a ""leader of our time"" when they met in 2019.
At the 2016 Oscars, he made a speech declaring climate change to be ""the most urgent threat facing our entire species"".

384,COP26,Georgina Rannard & Francesca Gillett,COP26: World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030,2021-11-02,"More than 100 world leaders have promised to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, in the COP26 climate summit's first major deal. 
Brazil - where stretches of the Amazon rainforest have been cut down - was among the signatories on Tuesday.
The pledge includes almost Â£14bn ($19.2bn) of public and private funds.
Experts welcomed the move, but warned a previous deal in 2014 had ""failed to slow deforestation at all"" and commitments needed to be delivered on.
Felling trees contributes to climate change because it depletes forests that absorb vast amounts of the warming gas CO2.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is hosting the global meeting in Glasgow, said ""more leaders than ever before"" - a total of 110 - had made the ""landmark"" commitment.
""We have to stop the devastating loss of our forests,"" he said - and ""end the role of humanity as nature's conqueror, and instead become nature's custodian"".
The two-week summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. 
The countries who have signed the pledge - including Canada, Brazil, Russia, China, Indonesia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the US and the UK (the full list is here) - cover around 85% of the world's forests.
Some of the funding will go to developing countries to restore damaged land, tackle wildfires and support indigenous communities.
Governments of 28 countries also committed to remove deforestation from the global trade of food and other agricultural products such as palm oil, soya and cocoa.
These industries drive forest loss by cutting down trees to make space for animals to graze or crops to grow.
More than 30 of the world's biggest financial companies - including Aviva, Schroders and Axa - have also promised to end investment in activities linked to deforestation. 
And a Â£1.1bn fund will be established to protect the world's second largest tropical rainforest - in the Congo Basin.

Prof Simon Lewis, an expert on climate and forests at University College London, said: ""It is good news to have a political commitment to end deforestation from so many countries, and significant funding to move forward on that journey.""
But he told the BBC the world ""has been here before"" with a declaration in 2014 in New York ""which failed to slow deforestation at all"". 
There are reasons to be cheerful about the proposed plan to limit deforestation, specifically the scale of the funding, and the key countries that are supporting the pledge.
It is also very positive that it will try to reinforce the role of indigenous people in protecting their trees. Studies have shown that protecting the rights of native communities is one of the best ways of saving forested lands.
But there are significant challenges.
Many previous plans haven't achieved their goals. In fact, deforestation has increased since a similar pledge was launched in 2014. 
There are often disputes between donors and recipients - Norway suspended funding for an Amazon fund in 2019 in an argument with Brazil's president.
There are also major questions over how a major financial pledge could be effectively policed. 
How can funders verify that forests are actually being protected without spying from satellites or challenging national sovereignty in some way?
And question marks also hang over a key plank of the new plan, which is to try to remove the link to deforestation from consumer goods sold in developed countries. 
One aspect is eating meat from animals, raised on imported soy grown on cleared lands. Will governments push companies and consumers to eat less meat to save the world's most important forests?
Ecologist Dr Nigel Sizer called the agreement ""a big deal"" - but that some will find the target of 2030 disappointing. 
""We're facing a climate emergency so giving ourselves another 10 years to address this problem doesn't quite seem consistent with that,"" said Dr Sizer, a former president of the Rainforest Alliance. 
""But maybe this is realistic and the best that they can achieve."" 
The deal's signatories include a number of key countries. 
Indonesia is the world's largest exporter of palm oil, a product found in everything from shampoo to biscuits. Production is driving tree destruction and territory loss for indigenous people.
Meanwhile, Russia's huge natural forests, with more than one fifth of the planet's trees, capture more than 1.5 billion tonnes of carbon annually. 
In the planet's biggest rainforest, the Amazon, deforestation accelerated to a 12-year high in 2020 under Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
Asked whether leaders like Brazil's Mr Bolsonaro could be trusted to abide by the pledge, the UK's Environment Secretary George Eustice said ""we should be really positive when countries engage"".
""Last time there was an attempt at getting such a commitment on forests [in 2014], Brazil didn't take part, neither did Russia, neither did China.
""Brazil, they've really engaged with us on this agenda. It's a big step for them.""
But pressed on whether the agreement will be enforceable, Mr Eustice said: ""It doesn't go as far into talking about enforcement mechanisms and so forth, that's not the nature of these agreements.""
He said what was different about this pledge in particular is that there is ""the finance to back [it] up"".
US President Joe Biden said he was ""confident"" the global pledge could be met, telling world leaders: ""All we need to do is summon the will and do what we know is right. We can do this.""
He said the US would lead by example, and announced it would spend $9bn (Â£6.6bn) to conserve and restore forests.

Ana Yang, executive director at Chatham House Sustainability Accelerator, who co-wrote the report Rethinking the Brazilian Amazon, said: ""This deal involves more countries, more players and more money. But the devil is in the detail which we still need to see.""
But many people living in the Amazon, including in its urban areas, depend on the forest for their livelihoods and they need support in finding new incomes, she added. 
Prince Charles told COP26 delegates that nations had to ""honour"" the rights of indigenous people as they were ""experienced custodians"" of their habitats. And speaking to members of the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities - representing 24 countries with tropical rainforests - he said: ""We've got to work harder to save your forests, for all our sakes."" 
Tuntiak Katan, from the Coordination of Indigenous Communities of the Amazon Basin, welcomed the deal, saying that funds should be invested in supporting indigenous communities who are able to manage and protect forests.
Mr Katan, an indigenous Shuar from Ecuador, told the BBC indigenous communities globally protected 80% of the world's biodiversity but faced threats and violence.
""For years we have protected our way of life and that has protected ecosystems and forests. Without us, no money or policy can stop climate change,"" he said. 
One of the biggest causes of forest loss in Brazil is to grow soy beans, much of which goes to China and Europe for animal feed for pigs and chickens, said Dr Sizer. 
""We all end up consuming that, unless we're strict vegetarians and we don't eat soy. It's a very serious problem that we're all connected with.""
Trees are one of our major defences in a warming world. They suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, acting as so-called carbon sinks. They absorb around one third of global CO2 emitted each year.  
Under present targets, the world is on track for warming of 2.7C by 2100 - which the UN says would result in climate catastrophe.
Currently an area of forest the size of 27 football pitches is lost every minute.
Depleted forests can also start to release CO2. If too many trees are cut down, scientists are worried that the planet will reach a tipping point that will set off abrupt and unpredictable climatic change.
Also on the second day of the two-week climate summit:
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

385,COP26,Roger Harrabin,COP26: Leaders agree global plan to boost green technology,2021-11-02,"More than 40 world leaders say they will work together to turbo-charge the uptake of clean technologies by imposing worldwide standards and policies.
The announcement will be made at the climate summit COP26 in Glasgow on Tuesday.
Five high-carbon sectors will be targeted at first, including agriculture and electricity.
It aims to encourage global private investment in low-carbon technologies.
Similar international attempts have been made previously to push clean tech - but nothing as ambitious as this multi-lateral agreement.
Its backers want to reassure investors that global markets will be created for green technology and that it is a good financial bet.
It is hoped that eventually the initiative will help draw in trillions of dollars in private finance for cutting emissions.
The five sectors that the plan will cover at first are steel, road transport, agriculture, hydrogen, and electricity.
The initiative, known as the Glasgow Breakthroughs, was applauded by Nick Mabey from the climate think tank e3g. 
He told me: ""This potentially has real muscle. It takes climate change out of the negotiating halls and into the real economy.
""Imagine if major nations agreed to set a target for the amount of 'green steel' to be made. (That's steel made with hydrogen or electricity.) That would be really powerful by creating a market.""

The plan has been launched by the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, alongside representatives from the USA, India, EU, and - importantly - China. 
The signatories are said to represent more than 70% of the world's economy and every region.
A similar approach has been running in the EU where law-makers have steadily increased efficiency standards on electrical goods so they run creating fewer emissions. 
Crucially, firms wanting to export into the EU must reach the same standards - it's proved that higher standards in one part of the world can influence technology in another. It's hoped this process could be embraced and greatly expanded with the ""Glasgow Breakthroughs"".

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""By making clean technology the most affordable, accessible and attractive choice, the default go-to in what are currently the most polluting sectors, we can cut emissions right around the world.
""The Glasgow Breakthroughs will turbocharge this forward, so that by 2030 clean technologies can be enjoyed everywhere, not only reducing emissions but also creating more jobs and greater prosperity.""
Leaders have committed to discussing progress every year in each sector, starting in 2022. This work will be supported by annual reports, led by the rich nations' think tank, the International Energy Agency.
At the event today, world leaders, CEOs and philanthropists are also expected to launch:
The government's climate advisers will welcome clean technology initiatives - but they say the PM can't ignore the need for behaviour change, too - such as walking and cycling more and eating less meat and dairy.

387,COP26,BBC News,COP26: US and EU announce global pledge to slash methane,2021-11-02,"The US and the EU have announced a global partnership to cut emissions of the greenhouse gas methane by 2030.
EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen and US President Joe Biden made the announcement at the COP26 summit on Tuesday.
The Global Methane Pledge aims to limit methane emissions by 30% compared with 2020 levels.
It is one of the most potent greenhouse gases and responsible for a third of current warming from human activities.
More than 100 countries have signed up to the initiative, first proposed by the US and the EU in September. 
The main focus of efforts to curb global warming is carbon dioxide (CO2), which is emitted as a result of human activities such as generating power and clearing forests.
But there has been a growing focus on methane as a way of buying extra time to tackle climate change. Although there's more CO2 in the atmosphere and it sticks around for longer, individual methane molecules have a more powerful warming effect on the atmosphere than single CO2 molecules.
And while one of the key goals of COP26 is to get countries to commit to achieving net zero by 2050 - meaning not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - both leaders stressed that they needed to act now. 
""We cannot wait for 2050,"" EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told the summit. ""We have to cut emissions fast.""
She said cutting methane was ""one of the most effective things we can do to reduce near-term global warming"", calling it ""the lowest hanging fruit"".
US President Joe Biden echoed her words, calling methane ""one of the most potent greenhouse gases there is"".
The pledge covers countries which emit nearly half of all methane, and make up 70% of global GDP, the US president said. 
The speed with which the world has moved to tackle methane emissions gives real hope that the world is finally waking up to the massive threat posed by warming gases.
Just last August the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that methane was responsible for a significant proportion of the 1C of warming the world has already experienced.
In September, the EU and the US brought the global pledge into being, and have persuaded some significant emitters to join the club.
The thrust is to cut emissions by 30% by 2030. The main focus in the short-term will be the fossil fuel industry. Most of the curbs can be achieved at little or no cost.
The potential benefits are huge - scientists believe it could help the world avoid 0.3C of warming by 2040.
At a time where every fraction of a degree matters, that is a major saving that could help keep the 1.5C threshold in play.
But there are some significant clouds on the horizon.
Major emitters like Russia, China and India are not part of the pledge.
All the commitments are voluntary - there is no big stick.
Despite this, most observers see the pledge as a good step for the world and a boost for the conference.
Around 40% of CH4 comes from natural sources such as wetlands but the bigger share now comes from a range of human activities, ranging from agriculture such as cattle and rice production to rubbish dumps.
One of the biggest sources is from the production, transport and use of natural gas and since 2008 there has been a big spike in methane emissions, which researchers believe is linked to the boom in fracking for gas in parts of the US.
In 2019, methane in the atmosphere reached record levels, around two-and-a-half times above what they were in the pre-industrial era.
What worries scientists is that methane has real muscle when it comes to heating the planet. Over a 100-year period it is 28-34 times as warming as CO2.
Over a 20-year period it is around 84 times as powerful per unit of mass as carbon dioxide.
However, there is much more CO2 than methane in the atmosphere and individual molecules of it can remain there for hundreds of years.

388,COP26,BBC News,COP26: Bezos pledges $2bn for restoring nature,2021-11-02,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has said his Bezos Earth Fund will spend $2bn (Â£1.5bn) restoring landscapes and transforming food systems.
He told the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow that he had grasped nature's fragility when he travelled into space.
Entrepreneurs including Mr Bezos have been criticised for spending money on trips into space instead of solving problems on Earth.
Amazon has also been criticised by its workers over environmental practices.
Speaking to the COP26 conference, Mr Bezos said: ""In too many parts of the world, nature is already flipping from a carbon sink to a carbon source.""
The Bezos Earth Fund plans to spend $10bn fighting climate change overall.
In Glasgow the founder of the world's biggest online retailer described the experience of travelling on his rocket ship, New Shepard, in July as a revelation of Earth's vulnerability.
""I was told that seeing the Earth from space changes the lens from which you view the world but I was not prepared for just how much that would be true,"" he said.

How extreme weather is linked to climate change
""Looking back at Earth from up there, the atmosphere seems so thin, the world so finite and so fragile. Now, in this critical year and what we all know is the decisive decade, we must all stand together to protect our world.""
In September, the Bezos Earth Fund pledged $1bn towards conserving nature and indigenous peoples and cultures.
Announcing the follow-up $2bn pledge on Tuesday, Mr Bezos said that two-thirds of Africa's productive land was degraded but this could be reversed. 
""Restoration can improve soil fertility, raise yields and improve food security, make water more reliable, create jobs and boost economic growth, while also sequestering carbon,"" he told COP26.
As well as Mr Bezos, Sir Richard Branson and Elon Musk are building up space businesses.
Last month, Prince William suggested entrepreneurs should focus on saving Earth rather than engaging in space tourism.
Amazon has also been criticised in the past by its workers over its record on climate change.
Last year, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice called on the online retail giant to achieve zero emissions by 2030, limit its work with fossil fuel companies, and stop funding for politicians and lobbyists who deny the existence of climate change.
In April this year, US labour officials found that Amazon retaliated illegally when it fired two employees who were part of the group.

389,Climate change,BBC News,Insulate Britain protests target M56 and M25,2021-11-02,"Insulate Britain protesters blocked a road near the M56 as part of a series of demonstrations across the country.
About a dozen people joined the protest on the A538 Wilmslow Road, near Manchester Airport, with some gluing their hands to the road.  
Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said 11 people had been arrested on suspicion of causing danger to road-users.
The protest group also targeted the M25 near London, where there were also arrests, and Birmingham city centre.
Insulate Britain said about 60 demonstrators descended on junction 23 of the M25 in Hertfordshire, the A538 (Wilmslow Road) in Greater Manchester and the A4400 in Birmingham from about 08:00 GMT.
The London and Manchester roads are part of the strategic road network and covered by a super injunction granted to National Highways last week.
Insulate Britain - which campaigns for homes to be low energy by 2030 to fight fuel povertyÂ - said it was taking its message ""outside of London"".
""Britain should be leading the world with radical plans to decarbonise our society, instead our government is actively setting policies that will drive emissions higher,"" it added in a statement.
About a dozen protesters blocked Wilmslow Road, including seven who glued their hands to the road.
One of the protesters, Stephanie, said the group wanted to put pressure on the government to insulate homes to help tackle the climate crisis.
""Insulating our houses is the simplest, easiest first step towards tackling climate change, 15% of our emissions are because of our heating and our housing,"" she said.
GMP said the demonstration caused delays but it had ""kept disruption to a minimum"" and officers had ""ensured access"" to the M56 and Manchester Airport.
The force said all roads in the area had returned to normal by about 13:00.

Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham tweeted: ""I can't see how this type of protest does anything other than alienate people from the climate cause.""
The leader of Trafford Council, councillor Andrew Western, said the protest was ""a sure fire way to lose hearts and minds on the climate crisis issue"". 
He branded it ""selfish, self-indulgent and dangerous"" and said the protesters were ""not helping anybody"".
By BBC North of England Bureau senior journalist Michaela Howard
Eleven Insulate Britain protesters walked on to the road at around 08:30, sitting down in front of cars as the traffic lights were red, pulling out their banners.
Sitting in a line, seven of the protesters glued their hands to the road with the others sat on the ground.
There were a handful of police officers initially on scene but numbers have increased to around two dozen.
There hasn't been a great deal of traffic disruption and there has been a mixed response from passing motorists, some hooting their horns in support but many shouting at the protesters.
Elsewhere, 20 people were arrested after protesters attempted to block the M25 by gluing themselves to the road.
Hertfordshire Police were called to junction 23 for the A1(M) at Bignells Corner at 07:45 and to the A1081 St Albans Road at 08:20.
Officers said they managed to intercept the protesters before they reached the M25 carriageway.
By 10:00, police said all protesters had been removed and the road was being reopened.
The force said 20 people had been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance and four were also arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage.
Protesters also disrupted morning traffic by sitting in the road around Great Charles Street Queensway in Birmingham city centre.
West Midlands Police said about 20 people had ""briefly and intermittently"" blocked traffic for about an hour, causing minimal disruption, with no arrests made.
Insulate Britain activists have blocked roads on 18 days since 13 September, a move that has seen drivers stuck in long queues of traffic.
Before Tuesday's action, 161 people had been involved in the roadblock campaign, with 770 arrests.

390,COP26,Glenn Campbell,'Very difficult' to hit climate goals - UN chief,2021-11-02,"UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said it will be ""very difficult"" for COP26 to secure deals to limit global temperature increases to 1.5C.
Mr Guterres told BBC Scotland it was possible to keep the target alive, but said he is very worried that political divisions could prevent progress.
World leaders have gathered in Glasgow for the annual UN climate conference.
But Mr Guterres said there was a ""serious problem of trust"" between developed and developing countries.
He urged wealthy countries to make good their commitments to provide $100bn per year in funding for climate change mitigation and adaption in the developing world.
The main aim of the Glasgow talks is to try to hit the target set in the Paris Agreement in 2015, of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial times.
Some 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030, but Mr Guterres told BBC Scotland that a lack of trust between nations was the ""most serious problem"" the negotiations face.
He said: ""I still think it is possible to take decisions to keep 1.5 alive, but I am very worried with the geopolitical divides, with the issues of cooperation namely between developed countries and emerging economies. There is still a long way to go to come to a reasonable compromise.
""I hope that in Glasgow we can solve several serious problems, for instance over the establishment of carbon markets. But the central question is to come to a set of national contributions which guarantees 1.5, it will be very difficult to reach it in Glasgow, which means the next day we must start again.
""I don't think we can wait five years for the next set set of national contributions - from now on it must be a permanent exercise, we must have every year a commitment to improve.""
The UN Secretary General said he did not think the potential for a new coal mine in Cumbria or new oil and gas developments elsewhere in the UK ""undermine entirely"" the UK's leadership on climate change.
He said that while it was not for him to decide the future of the proposed Cambo oil field to the west of Shetland, ""we don't need more oil and gas"".
On Monday, he told delegates at the conference that ""addiction to fossil fuels is pushing humanity to the brink"", saying: ""We face a stark choice - either we stop it, or it stops us. We are digging our own graves.""
Mr Guterres also expressed ""enormous gratitude"" to Glasgow and the Scottish people for ""wonderful hospitality"".
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

391,COP26,Sally Bowman,Nottingham battery made from old Volvo truck engines shown at COP26,2021-11-02,"An innovative energy storage battery, fed by repurposed Volvo truck engines, is being showcased at the COP26 climate conference.
Energy storage company Cheesecake, based at the University of Nottingham, has developed the technology.
The system uses compressed air and thermal storage to produce energy on demand.
Its makers say it will have a dramatically lower environmental impact than traditional lithium-ion batteries.
The company said that while many battery systems rely on the mining of rare or hazardous elements, this system uses readily-available materials like gravel to store electricity.
""The compressed air heats up and that heat is stored [as electricity]... within 20 tonnes of gravel,"" Mike Simpson, one of the company's co-founders, said.
""This is a really good, cheap and compact way of storing heat.
""The system draws on very well-established principles and it's a really sustainable approach.
""We are using hardware and skills that already exist but in a clean energy context.
""It's hugely exciting,"" he said.
Dr Andrew Naylor, CEO of Nottingham Technology Ventures, said: ""We're excited by the potential of [this] technology to reduce the cost of energy storage as the world moves towards cleaner methods of energy production.""

392,Climate change,BBC News,Olympian talks up Isle of Man's sustainable cycling future,2021-11-02,"The Isle of Man has a ""real opportunity"" for people to travel more environmentally, an Olympic cyclist has said. 
Chris Boardman visited the island to give talks on the subject to various groups as well as school children. 
The two-day trip was organised by the Isle of Man Cycling Association.
Boardman, who is now the transport commissioner for Greater Manchester, said it was vital to find alternatives to car travel.
He said the Isle of Man had not reached the same ""point of saturation"" as in England, meaning ""there's a real opportunity to enable people to travel differently"".
Boardman visited St Ninian's High School in Douglas during his trip, where he spoke to young people about travelling to and from school. 
One pupil, James, 14, said he cycled to school but would often ride on the pavement to avoid heavy traffic. 
Cycling was ""faster than getting the bus or in the car sometimes"", he added.
Seventeen-year-old Ntshila said she would be more likely to hop on a bike if there were more cycle lanes.
She said: ""It's good for your health and it's more efficient than walking and better for the environment than driving.""
The island's cycling development officer Rob Holden said it was important to understand what might be putting some children off cycling.
""It might be that they get to a busy main road and they can't get across, or they don't like the volume of traffic, it's intimidating,"" he said.
""So it's seeing if there are any interactions we can put in place that will just reduce the barriers.""

393,COP26,Louise Cullen,NI agriculture: Is it a case of 'green' versus growth?,2021-11-02,"Agriculture in Northern Ireland feeds 10 million people across the UK.  
But it's also Northern Ireland's biggest producer of greenhouse gases (GHG) - responsible for 27% of emissions.  
The industry is feeling the pressure to reduce that amount, while also calling for the work it does to protect the environment to be recognised.  
The land in Northern Ireland is mostly suited to raising meat and dairy, but cows produce methane in large quantities. Methane is a potent, if short-lived, GHG.  
""I think we need to be given credit for what we do to sequester carbon,"" says Jessica Pollock.  
She's a young farmer, running a dairy farm just outside Castlederg, County Tyrone.  
""There's very few other industries that can sequester carbon, so I think from that perspective, yes, cows do emit a lot of methane. But we also sequester a lot of carbon, so this needs to be accounted for.""
She has introduced some green measures since taking over her family farm after returning from university.  
There is a robotic scraper - it helps reduce emissions from cows waste by removing it from the open air more quickly and regularly than can be done by hand.  
And the farm itself is powered by a water turbine she installed, along with solar panels on the outbuildings.  
All these innovations cost money.  
""Making sure the farm is profitable to sustain that until that can make a profit for you is necessary,"" she says.
""It's very difficult to implement strategies without being profitable on farms.""
But one expert says innovations are only a part of the puzzle.  
""Farmers are the stewards of the land, they have particular challenges,"" says John Barry, professor of green economics at Queen's University Belfast.  
""We're going to have to shift to where we're subsidising farmers to sequester carbon, to pay them to re-wet bogs and peatlands, and there's some experiments already going on, to plant native trees because this sucks out carbon from the atmosphere.  
""This is not about reducing and destroying the beef and dairy herd, but we have to recognise the science.""
Stephen Murdock can see the science in his fields.  
He grows vegetables near Comber and is in a race to harvest his broccoli.
""We should finish cutting broccoli middle-November, but we're here just past the middle of October and all the broccoli is ready.""
It's a different issue with some of the other brassicas he grows.  
""The problem with cauliflowers is, between losing them in the dry weather in the summertime and the frost in the wintertime, you maybe only have 70% cut,"" Stephen says.
""So, with price pressure from supermarkets - quality, you know - we basically dropped the cauliflowers in the really cold weather and the really hot weather, but we're back to a 12-month programme now.""
Elsewhere in his fields, the water lies - drowning cauliflowers that will go unpicked. The land is simply too boggy to get to them.  
Regardless of which of the climate bills currently progressing through Stormont crosses the legislative line first, agriculture is in the crosshairs for targets to reduce the emissions it produces.  
It's something Jessica has mixed feelings about.  
""What is good for the environment is often good for farms too,"" she says.
""I do think it's very important that every farm is progressing.  
""It's just at what speed and they're capability to do it with the profit margins they have.""

Freedom of Information requests showed the Hampshire Pension Fund invested Â£45.5m in coal and Â£90.5m into oil and gas as of April 2020.
Environmentalists called on the councils to ""invest in clean energy"".
The fund said it aimed to ""positively engage"" with companies.
The county council, Portsmouth and Southampton unitary authorities, and 11 borough or district councils use the fund as an investment vehicle, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
The Freedom of Information requests were made by Friends of the Earth and campaign group Platform.
Co-founder of the Final Straw Foundation, Bianca Carr, said it was ""ethically... the wrong thing"" as the COP26 summit gets underway in Glasgow.
She said: ""Local authorities should be setting an example for others to follow, so I find it very strange for them to be investing in fossil fuels.
""Why they aren't investing in clean energy - especially when they have declared a climate emergency - is beyond me. It seems counter-intuitive, nonsensical even.""
A spokeswoman for the Hampshire Pension Fund Panel and Board said 1.9% of its funds were invested in fossil fuel companies, lower than the average of 3.1% for English local government pension scheme funds.
""The fund's policy is not to disinvest from any particular company or industry, such as fossil fuel producers, but to positively engage with these companies through its investment managers and to influence positive change in this way,"" she said.
She added the carbon footprint of the fund's investments has reduced over the last year.
In Hampshire, the county council, Portsmouth and Southampton city councils, and the boroughs of Basingstoke and Deane, East Hampshire, Fareham, Rushmoor, Test Valley and Winchester have all declared climate emergencies.

So the autistic designer created a role-play game to save the planet in the hope players might continue the battle in the real world.
With players gathered round the table, a session of Ecopunk is under way, a role-playing game set in 2044. It's like Dungeons and Dragons but with more politics and environmental collapse. 
To play, all you need is the game book and some character sheets to keep track of your energy, skills and inventory. You also need a lot of dice. 
Its designer is Liam Hevey from Nunhead in south-east London. He is autistic and grew up to think with a large degree of what he calls ""political dissidence"". He didn't like or understand the way the world runs, with its ""irrational"" norms and ideas that everyone else seems to accept. 
This is a familiar feeling to many autistic people - if something in the world doesn't make sense then it needs to be corrected and smoothed out.
It has led Liam to have a passion for environmentalism, and frustration at the lack of coordinated action to save the planet.
He refers to the present climate emergency as ""the defining moment"" of his life and in a dark mood he adds it could well be the thing that will ""end it"".
Your imagination, and the rules, are the only limits in Ecopunk but the story is dark, dystopian and perhaps a little too familiar.
After failing to act in the early 21st century, the climate is in fast decline, and the human race is in a death spiral. You could find yourself playing the part of a disillusioned hacker with a love for tofu, a bitter soldier with a cybernetic arm, or a botanist with a knack for brewing. They are Punks, they're out-of-step with society and they are fighting to keep humanity alive.
Liam explains that the story starts with the crisis going into full swing. 
""Politics has broken down and reformed and restructured around a new reality. We no longer live in this period of capitalism ... and America has kind of fallen apart."" 
Liam has imagined three new superpowers have risen to the top: The Central African Socialist Union, the Chinese Empire and the European Commune.
Each offers their own ideological response to the world's problems: imperialism, neo-Marxist collectivism, or eco-fascism respectively.
You want complex world building? You've got complex world building.
The players, or Punks, exist at the edges of these nations, and, as their name suggests, they do not participate in the politics but still have to engage with them to survive.   
Like fellow autistic campaigner Greta Thunberg, Liam has suffered from climate anxiety which is now being talked about more, especially amongst younger people. And, like Greta, he too experienced panic attacks when he was younger.
Creating the game has helped give him some control back over the situation. 
Months of writing and play-testing have culminated in hundreds of pages of rules, missions, mechanics and lore.
Liam realises that a numbers-obsessed man who enjoys socialising with people over dice and scoresheets is a bit of an autistic stereotype. It's this aspect of role-play games which he thinks gives it that nerdy image. 
But Liam says much of his interest is in the role-playing part of the game where you don another personality. It's not mathematical, it's more about slipping into the shoes of a character, to think how they think and interact in this fantasy world. 
He found that role-playing as characters who were, for example, charismatic or confident, helped him apply this to himself.
I put it to him that this sounds like masking, where autistic people adopt neurotypical behaviours to fit in, which can be very tiring and often means suppressing your natural autistic traits.
Liam says it's not the same for him, but recognises the similarities and says role-playing provides a ""safe space"" for other people to practice masking
During October, Liam ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to fundraise just under Â£15,000 for Ecopunk. Kickstarter is a website which, as the name suggests, helps people gather funding to start projects the community believes in. He was helped by Arts Council England, Shape Arts and a team of artists.
A basic version of the game is already available for free as a PDF download - the fundraising will go towards a ""professionally produced"" release with extensive artwork, and a physical version which he is keen to say will be carbon neutral. 
Liam wants the game to make people think more about environmental issues and hopes players will leave the game and ""fight for the future"" like they did when they played.

397,COP26,BBC News,COP26: Pledge to end deforestation as Queen urges 'rise above politics',2021-11-02,"Here are five things you need to know about the COP26 climate change conference on Tuesday.
In the COP26 summit's first major deal, more than 100 world leaders will promise to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. The commitment, with almost Â£14bn pledged in public and private backing, is supported by nations covering about 85% of the world's forests, including Canada, Brazil, Russia, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. But analysts warn a deal struck in 2014 ""failed to slow deforestation at all"". Felling trees contributes to climate change because forests absorb vast amounts of the warming gas CO2. 
In a video message to the summit in Glasgow, the Queen urged world leaders to create a ""safer, stabler future"" for the planet. She told them to take the long view and ""rise above the politics of the moment"". Among Monday's other key developments:

The arrival of world leaders has triggered a series of demos across Glasgow, with environmental campaign Greenpeace sailing its Rainbow Warrior ship up the Clyde and Extinction Rebellion protesters welcoming delegates at Central station. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg told an event near the COP26 campus by the Fridays for Future youth movement that politicians were merely ""pretending to take our future seriously"".

A lot of big-hitters might be in Glasgow but if anything positive is to come out of the summit, there's a good chance it will be thanks to the hard work of people whose name you might never have heard. Environment correspondent Matt McGrath runs through five dealmakers whose efforts will be crucial during negotiations.

""It felt great to be heard,"" Samoan climate activist Brianna Fruean, 23, says after addressing world leaders at the opening of COP26. ""The words I shared didn't just belong to me - they belong to my community, they belong to every single Pacific island."" Brianna has been campaigning since a teacher at primary school told her climate change might cause islands such as Samoa, Tutuila in American Samoa and Tonga to ""drown"".

Ever wondered about the obsession with the figure 1.5C? The rapid climate change we are seeing now is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. When these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2) - that trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.
The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%. In order to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists say global warming needs to be limited to 1.5C by 2100.

398,COP26,BBC News,Doctor pedals climate change message to Glasgow,2021-11-02,"A doctor is cycling to the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow while towing a block of ice.
Jet McDonald has taken a week off work to ferry the washing up bowl-sized block to the international summit. 
The 50-year-old, from Bristol, set off on Monday and aims to complete the 400-mile journey by Sunday.
Upon arrival, he plans to leave the ice block as close as he can get to the negotiations ""as an image that we really need to act now"".
He told BBC Bristol he believed the melting ice block would provide a really ""strong visual image"" for the effect that climate change is having on the planet.
He added: ""If we don't act, that melting ice is just going to continue melting.
""And all of the climate changes that we are seeing in the environment are going to continue unhindered.
""So that action needs to be now. Not just talk.
""Hopefully that melting ice block alongside the negotiations will really make that clear.""
Dr McDonald plans on riding between 50 and 60 miles a day and is doing the challenge in his scrubs.
The keen cyclist - who has previously pedalled from Bristol to India - said the distance would not be a challenge for him normally, but he has to wait and see what effect towing the ice has.
In preliminary runs, the block lasted a day before melting.
Therefore to arrive in the Scottish city with some ice, he has strategically planned his route so he can start each day with a new block.
He explained: ""I've got a network of fellow cyclists who are putting me up every night.
""They are going to freeze a block of ice for me in their freezer.
""And then the next morning I am going to carry on to the next place.
""Hopefully all seven days I will have an ice block that will last me the whole way to Glasgow.""

402,COP26,Debbie Jackson,COP26: Welsh villagers and Namibian lobbyist make climate pleas,2021-11-02,"Welsh pensioner Jane Lansfield has come to COP26 in Glasgow for her grandchildren.
The softly-spoken, almost whispering, grandmother is perhaps not what you would imagine a typical Extinction Rebellion protester to look like.
But Jane entered activism after watching her community suffer a battering from floods and changing weather patterns.
For her, COP26 is about fighting for her grandchildren's futures.
While Boris Johnson, Joe Biden and Greta Thunberg are making the headlines, tens of thousands of delegates and visitors are all trying to achieve their own outcomes from the summit.
For some it's making their voices heard, for others it's about making contacts that could help their countries secure help as they adapt to climate change.
Peter Weldon has cycled through wind and rain, all the way from Wales, to bring a letter to Alok Sharma.
The letter, from the mayor and town council of Cardigan, will be passed on and on until it gets into the hands of the COP president. 
He told the BBC: ""It says 'please make the decisions necessary to limit global heating to 1.5'. Get your finger out, basically.""
He added: ""The people running our country have got to be brave and make the correct decisions to make a difference, stop greenwashing and cling onto their authority.""
Anna Munro is also here to make the case for communities like Cardigan. ""We have had some serious flooding,"" she said. 
""It has badly, badly affected a lot of people in Cardigan and in the local Welsh area and also we have lots of farmers who are already worried about crop failures. Everybody is already starting to see the signs of climate catastrophe.""
Peter and Anna have joined Jane in the ranks of XR to try to convince leaders that profit should no longer come before people and planet.
Jane said: ""Profit is a mirage if you can't live in the future and give your children and grandchildren what they deserve - a world which is habitable, which can produce reliable crops for them to eat, for them to breathe clean air. Anything else is a nonsense.
""I just feel this really matters and it has to be now and that's why I am here to help them to witness that, "" said Jane. ""Because I don't want to look my grandchildren in the eye and say I haven't tried.""
The stakes are high for delegates attending from developing countries.
Many are expected to return from COP26 with tangible results. 
Alfeus Vatilifa Shekunyenge is in Scotland on behalf of the Namibian government. He is hoping to return with some real money. He feels the pressure.
""We are hoping to meet with different climate financing institutions hoping to secure some funds to go back home and implement our climate related activities,"" he says.
""Climate change is affecting us very badly - Namibia is already a dry country. We have unpredictable climate variability and the majority of people depend on climate sensitive sectors for their livelihood. We have experienced a lot of droughts and flooding and outbreaks of diseases so climate change is already very real for us.
""I hope that we get solutions here, that the developed countries pledge more money towards climate financing and we get financial and technical assistance to implement the activities we need to mitigate climate change.""
Brian Mounde Ondieki feels the weight of his country on his shoulders as COP26 begins in earnest. 
He is a climate change officer in the ministry of environment and forestry in Nairobi, Kenya.
He says he feels under pressure to bring home a good result from Glasgow for his country.
He says: ""Yes, I feel like everyone back in my country is looking upon us to make sure we get a good outcome out of this COP26. I cannot think about failing. I am putting my hopes high.""
Mr Ondieke is here to follow the mitigation agenda.
He tells the BBC: ""I'm hoping that we will get a good outcome - the goal towards net zero and a good conclusion in going to achieving 1.5C
""The challenges we face in Kenya are that the developed countries have not yet achieved what they promised. It is very frustrating.
""If I could meet President Biden today I would urge him to ensure that the promise that was made to achieve the goal of $100bn by 2020, that this is achieved, so that developing countries can have the funding to make adaptations.""
The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

She said: ""The ice is melting in the North Pole because of greenhouse gases causing the planet to get hotter. 
""Sea levels are rising. It is important that the polar bears, and all animals have somewhere to live. This also causes drought in some places in the world. If we don't protect our planet, we won't survive."" 
""Scotland must get its house in order for the world's gaze to be upon us,"" said Laura who is trying to live an environmentally conscious lifestyle and encourage others to do so.

""Together we unite and stand for climate justice with our global neighbours who are facing the impacts right now."" 
Nic said we that in order to reduce carbon emissions ""we need to understand the root causes of the issue"". 
""To do that we need to ask questions of how we want to live our lives, what really matters to us and how we can live healthily and happily. 
""These questions need to be asked at global, local and personal levels."" 
Sarra said organisations like The John Muir Trust have been a huge help with raising awareness.
""Now it's up to us to take action and take the next steps in our life to combat climate change. All it takes is for everyone to come together and play their wee part, because together we can make change.""
""Urgent climate action is needed now, not soon, not later. 
""Our world leaders need to do something, and I sincerely hope they take COP26 as a chance to prove that they do care for the planet and all it's inhabitants."" 
The Remade Network is a grassroots social enterprise which wants the public to rethink their relationship with their possessions.
""Repair is an important part of reducing our collective impact on the planet. 
""It is both a radical and practical solution to consumption and consumerism,"" said Lauren.
""As a scientist, I've naively thought for a long time that climate change is only an environmental issue,"" said Sofia.
""I'm optimistic that in COP26, people from different backgrounds will imagine and build a fair future that prioritises our collective wellbeing.""
 ""COP 26 is a huge opportunity for us in Glasgow to put words into action at home,"" said Zahra.
""The first move to a sustainable global climate initiative is decolonisation. It's collaboration. It's having difficult conversations about how we got in this mess, accepting accountability and ensuring equality and access to knowledge for all.""
""There's no environmental justice without social justice, said Blair.
""In every crisis it's people who are already marginalised and oppressed that bear the brunt. 
""Whether it's in Glasgow or the Global South, we need to make sure that our response to the climate crisis works for everyone - people of colour, disabled people, women, queer people and the poor.""

""We need to speak the truth, people don't like to be lied to, but we need to keep a positive message and give opportunities for people to engage with solutions,"" he said 
""Only by engaging with solutions people will feel empowered to take action and embrace the green transition.""

404,COP26,Bethan Lewis,Climate change: New schools in Wales must be net zero from 2022,2021-11-02,"New school and college buildings in Wales will have to meet net zero targets from January.
Major refurbishments, extensions and new builds will have to be in line with standards aimed at achieving maximum energy efficiency.
Llancarfan Primary School will be the first new school.
Education minister Jeremy Miles said the new rules would help reverse climate change damage.
The Â£5m Vale of Glamorgan school will generate its own power and have electric car chargers.
As well as aiming to be energy efficient once built, the building process should also limit carbon emissions.
Assistant site manager Dafydd Williams said everything was geared towards achieving net zero.
""Everything is measured correctly so we don't have too much material,"" he said.
""Everything in this building is procured using local contractors, obviously saving on the carbon of them travelling from a distance."" 
The firm is also trialling the use of electric forklifts on site.
The new Welsh government rules demand a 20% cut in carbon emitted by construction and the sourcing of materials.
And they are set to get stricter.
Education minister Jeremy Miles said it was ""an important contribution to our ambitious plan"" of a net zero Wales by 2050.
""We're seeing an improvement in the school estate year-on-year right across Wales,"" he said. 
""But there are many older schools in Wales and it is a greater challenge to make sure they play their part.""
They are being examined to see what improvements need to be made. 
""That will enable us to come up with a plan over time to retrofit those schools as well,"" Mr Miles said.
He said Llancarfan school would feature QR codes which, when scanned, explain the building's technology and how it helps tackle climate change.
Deputy head teacher Frances Williams described the new site as ""the 21st Century school that we've been dreaming of"".
""We've been doing project work in school based on new technologies and we're hoping that learning will continue as we move across as well,"" she said.
The new school will be in Rhoose, rather than four miles away in its namesake village of Llancarfan where the current school is.
The move has upset some, with more than 1,000 people opposing the plans over two consultations.
Ms Williams remained enthusiastic, adding: ""The facilities are absolutely amazing and the learning opportunities that those are going to bring are equally exciting for us.""
Net zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
Achieving it will involve reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out any that remain by removing an equivalent amount.
Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) are released when we burn oil, gas and coal for our homes, factories and transport. This causes global warming by trapping the sun's energy.

405,Climate change,Sabrina  Lee & Geraint Thomas  ,COP26: Climate change graph 'needs more colours' as world gets hotter,2021-11-02,"The man behind a global warming stripe graphic said he's going to need more colours to represent future years in a warmer world.
From London Fashion Week to BBC News branding, Prof Ed Hawkins' visualisation has become an international symbol of climate change.
Each line represents the average temperature for a year - blue for colder years and red for warmer. 
Colours will just get darker, he said.
Prof Hawkins said choices made at COP26, the climate summit in Glasgow, will determine how dark the colours get.
The graphic was first used by the Reading University academic at the Hay Festival in 2018.
He said: ""I was looking for a way of very simply communicating the fact that our planet is warming and so I made a set of stripes for Hay.
""I could instantly see that members of the audience realised that something was happening and they could instantly visualise the fact that the planet was warming and that was affecting Hay itself.""
The colourful representation of temperature changes is now available for every country around the world.
Using the sequence for Wales from 1884 to present day, the colours gradually change from blues, to oranges, to dark reds.
The hottest years were in the past 30 years. 
""This is a signal of our warming world,"" said Prof Hawkins.
""This data is critical for policy-makers making decisions. It tells us that Wales has warmed about one-and-a-half times faster than the global average.
""So for every two degrees [Celsius] that the global temperature increases, Wales will increase by about three degrees in temperature.""
The stripes' climate history plays a key role in working out what's next for global warming.
Professor of paleoclimatology, Joy Singarayer, said studying the past is important to understanding the future.
So, as temperatures and CO2 levels have been higher historically, why are there concerns this time around?
She said: ""It's not due to natural variations in our orbits, in solar cycles or in volcanic eruptions and so on.""
Prof Singarayer said it's humans causing the changes.
""In Wales for example we can see evidence of that, from glacial valleys that have been scoured out by ice sheets to other evidence on the landscape of as warm, or warmer than present temperatures,"" she said.
Fall Bay, on the Gower, near Swansea, shows evidence higher temperatures in the past.
The shells of sea creatures and pebbles shows the sea level from 125,000 years ago - up to nine metres higher than it currently is.
Prof Singarayer says an extreme series of circumstances could result in water raising to similar levels in the future.
""We think we might see half a metre or a metre sea level rise by the end of the century, depending on our carbon emissions and most of that currently is due to ocean thermal expansion so as the world is getting warmer, the oceans are also getting warmer and so the volume of those is increasing,"" she said.
""But there's potential for ice melts in the future, from Greenland and Antarctica in particular and that will contribute to rising sea levels.
""We think that happened in the past. So that is part of the reason why we see those raised beaches there.
""In a kind of drastic climate change scenario where we don't reduce our carbon emissions, something like that may well be possible in several 100 years' time. And the difference from that past scenario is that climate change is undeniably being caused by us now.""
There is a limited time to act if the world is to stave off the worst effects of global warming, she said.
Interpreting the past plays a crucial role as we live through what could be a turning point in the future of the climate change.

406,COP26,BBC News,COP26: India PM Narendra Modi pledges net zero by 2070,2021-11-02,"India has promised to cut its emissions to net zero by 2070 - missing a key goal of the COP26 summit for countries to commit to reach that target by 2050.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the pledge, the first time India has set a net zero target, at the Glasgow summit.
Net zero, or becoming carbon neutral, means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. 
China has announced plans for carbon neutrality by 2060, while the US and EU aim to hit net zero by 2050.
The Indian leader is one of more than 120 leaders to have gathered in Glasgow for the two-week conference. 
Dozens gave speeches on Monday laying out goals to tackle the climate crisis, including UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, US President Joe Biden and UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres.
President Biden said that every day the world delayed in tackling climate change, the cost of inaction increased.
But he told delegates that the fight against global warming offered incredible opportunities for world economies.
India is the world's fourth biggest emitter of carbon dioxide after China, the US and the EU.
But its huge population means its emissions per capita are much lower than other major world economies. India emitted 1.9 tonnes of CO2 per head of population in 2019, compared with 15.5 tonnes for the US and 12.5 tonnes for Russia that year.
Mr Modi made the pledge as one of five commitments from his country.
They include a promise for India to get 50% of its energy from renewable resources by 2030, and by the same year to reduce total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes.
While the 2070 net zero target may have disappointed activists and experts in Glasgow, Mr Modi seems to have impressed people back home. 
India had ""clearly put the ball in the court of the developed world"" by announcing 500 gigawatts (GW) of non-fossil electricity capacity, half of energy from renewables, a reduction of emissions by one billion tonnes and emissions intensity of the GDP by 45% by 2030, according to Arunabha Ghosh, Chief Executive Officer of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a leading climate think tank. 
""This is real climate action. Now India demands $1tn (Â£722bn) in climate finance as soon as possible and will monitor not just climate action but also climate finance,"" Dr Ghosh said.
The BBC's Vikas Pandey reports that the prime minister appears to have found the middle ground for his base - he is seen as being serious about climate change but without compromising India's economic potential.
Most headlines are using words like ""big"" and ""major"" to describe the announcement, our correspondent reports.
India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi used most of his time in front of his fellow world leaders to underline the need for lifestyle changes as the greatest solution to climate change. 
But Mr Modi saved his biggest news to the last minute. 
Detailing what he termed were India's ""five elixirs"" for climate, Mr Modi announced that his country would adopt a net zero emissions target - by 2070.
This is quite a significant step for the world's third largest emitter, still getting more than 50% of the country's electricity from coal.
It has to be tempered by the fact that the date is far past the mid-century goal for carbon neutrality that scientists say is necessary to avert the most dangerous levels of warming.
But there has been a general welcome for the goal.
Mr Modi's address came after a strongly worded speech from UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres. Demanding that people stop ""treating nature like a toilet"" he sharply criticised continued use of fossil fuels, saying ""we are digging our own graves"".
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said future generations ""will judge us with bitterness"" if they failed at the conference, while US President Joe Biden said that ""none of us can escape the worst of what's yet to come if we fail to seize this moment"".
But outside the conference on the streets of Scotland's largest city, activists and protesters demanded more from global leaders. 
Teenage campaigner Greta Thunberg told a crowd of demonstrators that politicians at the summit are ""pretending to take our future seriously"".
""Change is not going to come from inside there. That is not leadership. This is leadership. This is what leadership looks like,"" she said to cheers.

407,COP26,David Shukman,COP26: What climate summit means for one woman in Bangladesh,2021-11-02,"The people of Gabura in Bangladesh are having everything that's most threatening about climate change thrown at them.
Storms keep wrecking their coastal defences, and rising sea levels are pushing salty seawater into their wells and fields.
Bangladesh is one of the countries hit hardest by extreme weather, and this vulnerable community is enduring exactly the kind of future that the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow is trying to avoid.
It's also experiencing the painful reality of a key issue at the talks - how a promise of financial help for the poorest nations remains unfulfilled after 12 long years. 
And the story of one woman, Shorbanu Khatun, represents all that's proved least effective about international efforts to tackle climate change so far.
I met her in 2009 when Gabura was still reeling from the aftermath of a cyclone that had left the village totally exposed to the waves. She and her four children were living in a makeshift shelter perched on a high narrow ridge, the only safe ground for about 5,000 people.
At every high tide, seawater poured through gaps in a series of earth embankments meant to hold back the sea. Whenever they could, the men of the village formed human chains to pass along handfuls of mud to fill the holes - mud was all they had, and it never really did the job.
'Hopenhagen'
To highlight the plight of the village - and the needs of all developing countries suffering from climate change - Oxfam offered Shorbanu the chance to make her case on a global stage. 
She made the long journey to Denmark in December 2009 to the COP15 climate conference, the equivalent of the meeting under way in Glasgow now.
When I saw her there, I asked what she made of the giant event - it was given the optimistic billing of ""Hopenhagen"".
""It's good to be with all these big people,"" she told me, and she seemed upbeat about the chances of them listening.
And as it happens, while Shorbanu was in Copenhagen, the richest nations made a promise to the poorest countries - that by 2020 they would give them $100bn a year to deal with the impacts of climate change.

At the time, this was seen as a breakthrough offer because it signalled to developing nations that their needs and losses were being taken seriously.
But 12 years later, that target has not been met and, as things stand, it won't be until 2023.
So what does this mean for Shorbanu and the people of Gabura?
A trickle of aid has reached them, but not remotely on the scale promised in Copenhagen, and much of the assistance that has got through was raised within Bangladesh. 
It has paid for sandbags to reinforce some of the mud embankments, though the biggest storms still break through.
A new school has been built and, when cyclones strike, the concrete structure serves as a storm shelter.
But all the time the rise of the sea, millimetre by millimetre, fuelled by the melting of the distant polar ice, contaminates local wells and keeps reducing supplies of drinking water.
""There is water everywhere around us,"" Shorbanu says, ""but it doesn't have any use. We have a serious crisis.""
The nearest safe source is more than a mile away, at a solar-powered desalination plant built by the charity Oxfam, but reaching it involves walking in punishing heat and then carrying a heavy container back again, every day.
Many people try to rely on water that's closer at hand, but find it causes skin diseases because of the high salt content and - for women in particular - washing in dirty water increases the likelihood of infections. 
Researchers are also investigating whether an increase in the amount of salt that women are drinking could explain the relatively high number of miscarriages in the region.
Shorbanu, now aged 44, sounds more worried and desperate than ever.
""We have no idea what we can do,"" she says. ""If people help us, then something can change. 
""We don't have the money to move to other places. I have nothing that I can give to my children.""
One of her sons now has a job on a shrimp farm. It's a growing industry as fields are turned into ponds, but it creates shortages of locally grown food, exacerbating problems of malnutrition.
What does Shorbanu most want from anyone who might read her story, especially the leaders deciding the outcome of the talks in Glasgow?
She wants a strong embankment, which will not be destroyed so easily, and easy access to drinking water.
But most of all, she says, she wants action: ""We have suffered a lot - we do not want our children and grandchildren to suffer more."" 
David Shukman has been reporting on climate change for nearly 20 years. This is his 10th COP summit.
