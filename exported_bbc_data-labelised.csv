0,0,COP26,Louise Cullen,Climate change: Will 2022 be the year NI gets legislation?,2022-01-02,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-northern-ireland-59742532,"Northern Ireland began 2021 without climate change legislation - and is ending the year with two bills in a race on the path to becoming law.  
Each have differing targets, with Climate Change Bill No. 1 proposing to reach Net Zero by 2045. 
The private member's bill from Green Party leader Clare Bailey is viewed as more ambitious than No. 2.
The second one, brought by the Agriculture and Environment Minister Edwin Poots, sets a target of an 82% reduction in emissions by 2050 - a figure aligned with what the Climate Change Committee says is possible given our reliance on agriculture. 
A short-lived bid to find a compromise between the two bills foundered in the autumn, and it remains to be seen which, if either, will cross the legislative finish line before this assembly's mandate ends in March.  
Farmers watched the goings-on at Stormont warily.
Some fear what any legislation will mean for herd numbers and methods of farming here. But amid the uncertainty, most acknowledge that the only thing they are sure of is that change is coming in 2022.  
Brexit posed problems for local fishermen, who said they'd been ""mugged"" during the share-out of the extra quotas. Organisations warned of a loss of millions of pounds to the economy for years to come. 
The Mournes began to recover slowly, after a huge gorse fire burned on Slieve Donard for three days in April.
It was the size of 365 rugby pitches, and devastated flora and fauna in the area of outstanding natural beauty, at a time of year when many birds and wildlife species were laying eggs and rearing young at ground level.
A plan to close the controversial Renewable Heat Incentive scheme and compensate owners was unveiled.
It proposed buying out participants at a total cost of around Â£68m - a prospect not welcomed by boiler owners. The consultation on closure and compensation closed in April and has yet to report back.
In November, the UK played host to the climate change conference, COP26.  
It saw a flurry of high-level agreements and side deals to tackle rising temperatures and their potentially catastrophic effects.  
There were agreements on the ""phase-down"" of coal, stopping and reversing deforestation, and increasing the use of electric vehicles. Taken far above our heads perhaps, but still relevant to Northern Ireland - for example, we are one of the most deforested parts of Europe, with just 8% of woodland cover.  
Schemes to redress that balance are already underway, with a new forest of native trees being planted in the hills above Belfast, and a One Million Trees programme putting saplings around the city. 
The largest ever outbreak of bird flu in the UK began in October. 
As cases spread in Great Britain, a protection zone was established in Northern Ireland.
Cases were identified in wild birds at the Waterworks in Belfast in November. The highly pathogenic disease was detected in three commercial flocks and a backyard flock in counties Tyrone and Antrim from November into December. 
Thousands of ducks and poultry have been culled. The minister said the compensation bill could run in to ""tens of millions"" of pounds.  
As the year drew to a close, a new energy strategy happened with a whimper rather than a bang, on one of the final pre-Christmas meeting days for the executive.  
It will be followed by an action plan early in the new year, officials said, with a ""significant"" pilot scheme to transform our home heating already planned.
This year will be another year of environmental focus. 
The proposals from COP26, if fully delivered on, only reduce global warming to just under 2C, which could still wipe some island nations and low-lying coastal areas off the map.  
Northern Ireland's contribution to reducing that impact has yet to be decided, but there will be a contribution, with changes and consequences for us all.

1,1,COP26,BBC News,EU plans to label gas and nuclear energy 'green' prompt row,2022-01-02,http://www.bbc.com//news/world-europe-59850093,"The European Commission has proposed plans to label some gas and nuclear power as green, prompting criticism from Germany. 
The proposal argues that gas and nuclear are key to helping transition to cleaner power. 
But Germany's environment minister called the plan ""absolutely wrong"".
It comes months after countries pledged to keep temperature rises within 1.5C at the COP26 climate summit. 
""It is necessary to recognise that the fossil gas and nuclear energy sectors can contribute to the decarbonisation of the Union's economy,"" the Commission's proposal says. 
Under the proposal, only gas and nuclear plants with the highest standards would be considered green. Nuclear plants would also have to have strict waste disposal plans, Deutsche Welle reports. While gas plants would have a limit of how much carbon dioxide is released per kilowatt-hour of energy produced. 
If a majority of EU members back the proposal then it will become law from 2023. 
France had reportedly pushed for nuclear power to be included. The country relies on nuclear energy for 70% of its electricity, although this will be cut to half over the next 15 years. 
France has also pledged to reduce its reliance on nuclear power by shutting down 12 nuclear reactors by 2035. 
The move has been criticised by Germany, which is in the process of phasing out nuclear completely and only has a few plants remaining.
German Environment Minister Steffi Lemke described the proposal as ""wrong"", adding that nuclear energy could lead to environmental disasters and large amounts of nuclear waste. 
Economy and Climate Protection Minister Robert Habeck called the plan ""greenwashing"", saying it ""waters down the good label for sustainability.""

2,2,COP26,BBC News,Denmark to make domestic flights fossil fuel free by 2030,2022-01-02,http://www.bbc.com//news/world-europe-59849898,"Denmark's government has announced a goal to make domestic flights fossil fuel free by 2030. 
In her New Year's address, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she wanted to ""make flying green"". 
However she acknowledged that the solutions to reach her target were not yet in place.
Denmark is aiming for a 70% cut in overall carbon emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.
""To travel is to live and therefore we fly,"" said Ms Frederiksen, announcing her plan.
""When other countries in the world are too slow, then Denmark must take the lead and raise the bar even more,"" she said. 
She added that achieving green domestic flights would be difficult but researchers and companies were working on solutions. 
The European manufacturer Airbus has announced plans to develop hydrogen-fuelled planes that could be operational by 2035. 
If the hydrogen used to fuel them is generated using renewable energy, this could be a way for Denmark to reach its goals. 
However it is unclear if the technology will be ready, and costs sufficiently low, for the 2030 target to be reached.
Sweden has also announced plans to make its domestic flights fossil fuel-free by 2030. It is also hoping to make international flights green by 2045. 
Earlier this year, the government there announced plans to introduce increased airport fees for high-polluting planes. 
Meanwhile France is moving to ban domestic flights where the same journey could be made by train in under two-and-a-half hours. 
The measures could affect travel between Paris and cities including Nantes, Lyon and Bordeaux.

5,5,Our Planet Now,Justin Rowlatt,California's fires threaten to ravage mighty sequoia forests,2022-01-01,http://www.bbc.com//news/science-environment-59842464,"California's giant sequoias are symbols of permanence - with some living for thousands of years. But the fierce wildfires ravaging the state threaten even these mighty trees, which are among the longest-lived organisms on Earth.
There is something primeval about giant sequoias. Their weird, broccoli-like branches wouldn't seem out of place with a long-necked dinosaur plodding by. 
And they are impossibly big: 30 or 40 people would have to link hands to hug the largest ones. The tallest trees are 90m (295ft) high. That's like a 30-storey tower block.
""They make you feel deep time"", sighs Christy Bingham, as she looks up at the biggest tree in the world - known as the General Sherman. 
""You can just sense standing here that this tree was born before Jesus."" 
Christy lowers her voice as she says this, as if out of respect. She's in charge of conserving these magnificent trees in the Sequoia National Park in the Sierra Nevada mountains - their last redoubt.
Sequoias live so long because they are exquisitely adapted to their environment, Christy tells me. 
There have always been fires in California and, in response, sequoias have developed insulating bark which can be up to a metre thick and which stops all but the hottest fires damaging the trees. 
But California's fires are changing. Christy leads me deeper into the forest, to show me what she means.
All you can hear is the sound of the wind in the leaves, the occasional cry of a raven and our footsteps crunching in the leaf litter. It is heaven. Until, that is, we walk over a ridge and the scene changes dramatically.
""This is what I wanted to show you, this was a giant sequoia grove"", she says. The landscape is monochrome now: grey or black, ash or cinders. Many of the huge trees have been reduced to columns of charcoal.
""Before 2015 no one saw a sequoia that looked like this,"" says Christy. She is crying now. ""You never saw a tree become a candle and burn up in this way before."" She points to the blackened remains of one of the biggest trees. 
""This 1,000- to 2,000-year-old tree should have lived another 500 to 800 years but it's gone."" 
Christy wipes her tears with the sleeve of her jacket. ""It will not sequester any more carbon. It will not be a spotted owl house. It's dead.""
It isn't just California's trees that have been suffering. Several hours' drive north we visit the Gold Rush-era town of Greenville. It used to be famous for its Wild West-style clapboard shops and its white painted church with its elegant wooden spire. 
All that is gone now, incinerated in the massive Dixie Fire this summer which burnt a million acres and cost some 600 million dollars to fight.
Nichoel Farris tells me how she got a text telling her to get out of town. An hour later the whole place - 1,500 buildings in total - had been erased, and her ""forever home"" with it.
""It took all the colour out of my life. Look, everything is just a shade of grey"", says Nichoel, gesturing towards the ashes of her house. ""We lost the future we'd planned for and built."" She's crying now. ""We lost our story"", she tells me.
But Nichoel hasn't lost all hope. She talks about how she wants to see the town rebuilt using the latest fire protection knowhow. She and her husband grew 80% of their food on their land and she hopes others will do the same. 
""Greenville could actually be a lighthouse community of sustainability and climate adaptation. And how we live in our new normal - because big fires are now the new normal,"" she says.
And, in the forest, Christy hasn't given up hope either. She expects to see baby sequoias sprouting here next year. They like burnt soil. And she says the forests need to be better managed, with dead wood and brush that can fuel fires cleared away.
What's more, a few of the trees, even here amongst the destruction, will survive. Christy starts to scrape with her fingers at the charred bark of a giant sequoia at the very edge of the grove. 
Not far in - about an inch or a couple of centimetres - and the charcoal gives way to reddish bark. ""This is just surface damage,"" she says. ""Look up at the leaves, lots of them have survived. This tree will live!""
The resilience of the sequoias should inspire us, says Christy: ""It is telling us we need to act on climate change now and that every little bit counts"". She turns to look me in the eye. 
""Every carbon reduction will help these forests persist,"" she says. And I notice her smile has returned as we walk on through the trees.

6,6,Climate change,BBC News,Colorado wildfires: Tens of thousands evacuated as blazes spread,2021-12-31,http://www.bbc.com//news/world-us-canada-59834897,"Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated and nearly 1,000 homes have been destroyed as wildfires spread through the US state of Colorado.
The fast-moving blazes are burning in Boulder County, north of Denver. Governor Jared Polis called it a ""New Year's Eve miracle"" that no deaths had been reported.
Some 30,000 people in the towns of Louisville and Superior were told to leave their homes on Thursday.
A state of emergency has been declared.
""It was in blink of an eye. This was a disaster in fast motion, all in the course of half a day,"" Governor Polis said in a news conference on Friday.
""Nearly 1,000 homes are gone,"" he added.
Winds of up to 105 mph (169 km/h) are fanning flames across the region amid a historic drought.
While previous fires in Colorado have been in rural areas, these latest blazes are burning in more suburban parts of the state. Thursday's fires, named the Marshall Fire and Middle Fork Fire, are coming relatively late in the season. 
At least some were sparked when power lines were toppled by strong winds, and they have quickly become the most destructive wildfires in the state's modern history. Experts say that wildfires in western North America have grown more intense in recent years. 
""This is our community so to watch it burn so quickly, so unexpectedly, is something that we are struggling to understand,"" said Gov Polis, who added that President Joe Biden had called to say he would sign a federal emergency declaration.
Some 370 homes went up in flames west of Superior and 210 were lost in the Old Town area of Superior, Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said.
A shopping complex and hotel were also destroyed, and about 6,000 acres were burned in total, the sheriff said. 
Snow had began falling near the fires on Friday morning, offering some reprieve to firefighters who say the remaining fires are expected to burn out shortly.
Neither of the two major hospitals in the area were affected, and all schools were ""spared"" from the flames, added Gov Polis. 
At least one first responder and six others were injured, Sheriff Pelle said, adding that more casualties were likely. 
One video taken outside a supermarket showed a dramatic scene as winds ripped through the car park.
Patrick Kilbride, 72, was at work in a hardware store when he heard the order to evacuate, The Denver Post reported. 
He rushed home but only had time to gather a few possessions before the flames engulfed the property. His pet dog and cat both died. 
""It's just a strange feeling to go from having everything to make your life comfortable to having nothing,"" he said.
Colorado has been experiencing extreme droughts in recent years. Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.
The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

7,7,Climate change,BBC News,Scotland's 100% renewables electricity target narrowly missed,2021-12-31,http://www.bbc.com//news/uk-scotland-59837782,"Scotland narrowly missed a key environment target for the equivalent of 100% of electricity used in 2020 to be generated from renewable sources.
Official figures show gross consumption from renewables - minus net exports - was 98.6%
The full 2020 total was up from 97.4% in the early part of the year. 
It comes after the Scottish government missed a target for 11% of non-electrical heat to be generated by renewables in 2020.
Energy Secretary Michael Matheson said the country continued to ""lead the way"" with its commitment to be net zero by 2045.
In 2019, Scotland met 90.1% of its equivalent electricity consumption from renewables, according to Scottish government figures.
The 100% target was set in 2011, when renewable technologies generated just 37% of national demand.
Some of Scotland's electricity is sold overseas, meaning it also uses significant amounts of non-renewable electricity.
The latest full-year figures also showed:
Over the first nine months of 2021, provisional figures show generation was down 22.3% compared  with the same period in 2020.
The Scottish government said this was ""mainly due to continued mild weather over the year adversely affecting hydro and wind generation"".
According to the Energy Statistics for Scotland, electricity consumption also dropped by 5.7% from 2019 to 2020.
However, gas consumption rose slightly by 2.4% on 2019.
Scotland has some of the most ambitious climate targets in the world, with its Climate Change Bill setting out a legally-binding target of reaching net-zero emissions by 2045.
By 2030, ministers want renewable energy generation to account for 50% of energy demand across electricity, heat and transport.
Michael Matheson said he was ""proud of the progress Scotland has made over the past year"".
The energy secretary added: ""This statement shows we are continuing to make good progress with the equivalent of 98.6% of gross electricity consumption being from renewable sources in 2020, which is up from 89.8% in 2019.
""Whilst we do have many challenges ahead of us if we are going to meet our ambitious targets, we have laid the groundwork in 2021 for Scotland to take important leaps forward towards net zero.""

9,10,COP26,Martin Webber,Business Review of 2021: Climate change and Covid,2021-12-30,http://www.bbc.com//news/business-59730492,"Over the past year governments all over the world told businesses to radically step up their strategies for going green and shifting away from fossil fuels. 
The Glasgow COP 26 Climate Conference in November saw the host, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, setting out why humanity had to ""act now"".
Mr Johnson declared: ""If we don't get serious about climate change today, it will be too late for our children to do so tomorrow"".  
After the two weeks of talking in Glasgow, a draft deal pledging to ""phase out"" use of the dirtiest fuel, coal, was rejected by the biggest coal users, China and India.
But climate experts welcomed the fact that a reference to coal did stay in the final agreement, with a commitment instead to ""phase down"" coal use.  
Many established business leaders have already got the message and some have already completely changed what they do.  
The Australian mining entrepreneur, Andrew Forrest, the CEO of Fortescue Metals Group, told the BBC how his firm's large iron ore trucks and trains were being converted to so-called ""green hydrogen"".  
To make ""green hydrogen"", renewable energy - like wind power - is used to create electricity that then splits water into oxygen and hydrogen.  That hydrogen is captured to use as a fuel. In a hydrogen engine, the main emission is harmless water vapour.  
""This is the day the fossil fuel industry has denied would come. There are huge sources of green hydrogen - if the world bothers to make the transition. My own company is making the transition right now,"" he said.  
The entrepreneur said he took a four year PhD to study the environment and had learned that ""global warming is frighteningly real.""    
In April he took Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, to his vast mining operations that dig out iron ore to make the world's steel.  
Mr Forrest described how the prime minister faced ""big beefy Australian workers"" who would put an arm round Mr Morrison, saying ""come on ScoMo we're all going green, what's taking you so long? Green is the future mate"". 
A few months after that visit, Scott Morrison committed to making Australia ""net-zero"" by 2050 in line with the US, Japan, the EU and UK. 
""Net zero"" means that any climate damaging emissions are offset by emissions that are removed from the environment. 
China, Russia and Saudi Arabia are focussing on a 2060 ""net zero"" target. India's target is 2070. 
Meanwhile, in Denmark, green hydrogen is being created at a site at Brande in Jutland in the west of the country, using rows of dedicated wind turbines that tower over the countryside.  
The hydrogen is then used to fuel the vehicles of a nearby green taxi firm called DRIVR, which have chosen the hydrogen option over battery electric taxis. 
""In the taxi industry, the most important thing is time,"" Haydar Shaiwandi, chief executive of DRIVR told us. 
""We can't charge electric vehicles fast. The hydrogen vehicles actually act like regular diesel vehicles because for recharging a hydrogen vehicle is a maximum of five minutes.""  
But while change is happening, many say it is not happening fast enough.  
One big concern is that the green option is usually still the more expensive one, so most businesses still put their cash into cheaper but polluting investments. 
The fear is that without more decisive government action to change economic incentives, business and investors won't be able to deliver on the pledges set out by their nation's political leaders. 
Among those worried is Tariq Fancy, a former high flyer in the world of sustainable investing. He used to work as chief investment officer for sustainable investing at Blackrock, one of the world's largest asset managers.  
Mr Fancy says that - by law - managers like Blackrock need to maximise future retirement income for their investors. 
He argues that managers can look at environmental considerations but ""can't lose any money by investing in something that's good for the world"" because they are legally prohibited from doing that.
""Little to none of what any of the financial services industry is doing is actually - in any meaningful way - doing anything to fight climate change,"" he says. 
Because of this, he argues that the sector is therefore slower to enact reforms ""that experts are telling us we need to"".  
Mr Fancy concludes: ""All of this is what I call a deadly distraction."" 
The International Energy Agency, which is funded by governments of major western nations, made headlines in 2021 with a stark declaration. 
The IEA said that to meet governments' goal of limiting warming for the planet to an extra 1.5C, then there should be no development of any new fossil fuel fields. 
The IEA's chief energy economist Tim Gould says the world got closer to that scenario at Glasgow but ""we're not there yet"", he says. 
""In our view COP26 was all about setting ambitions. The acid test will be how quickly these are implemented. The time now is to really roll up the sleeves and put these pledges into practice."" 
For many years, Irwin Stelzer from the conservative US think-tank, the Hudson Institute, has supported a tax on carbon to encourage the private sector to invest more in green technology.
""Having waged this battle for a decade now and emerging bloody but unbowed, I would say a straight carbon tax will not pass,"" he tells me.    
But he is watching closely EU plans for a ""border tax"" on imported goods produced using ""dirty fuels"" - such as steel produced in China. 
""The EU may turn out to be one of the engines of progress, which is not its usual role. When they have border taxes, that tax imports for their carbon content, other nations will have to respond with similar taxes that will have the same effect."" 
The US will end up with its own border tax as well, Irwin Stelzer says: ""The politics is now falling in place to have some form of carbon pricing - directly or indirectly.""  
While policymakers were focussing on the long term in 2021, they also had a major job shoring up spending in the short term as the Covid pandemic hit activity for a second year. 
Most of the worst forecasts for the impact of Covid on jobs and incomes did not materialise.  Indeed most economies saw output return to levels seen before the pandemic. 
And by the end of 2021, there was growing concern about inflation set off by governments and consumers spending too much.  
Prices in the US are now 7% higher than a year ago - the fastest inflation rate since 1982.  
Ken Rogoff, former chief economist at the IMF, blames Covid-related supply chain issues in part, but says poor US government policy is also to blame.
""The stimulus - the American Rescue Plan - that the government put into place just after President Biden took office was just not well thought out or well designed.  It was throwing money at the economy - too much, too late,"" he says. 
""Frankly what they are doing now with infrastructure and social infrastructure would have done better to do back then."" 
For the big tech giants, it was another profitable year. Shares of the electric car firm, Tesla, rose 40%. Shares of Facebook (now known as Meta) were still up 20% despite a deluge of bad publicity after a former employee released internal documents.  
Frances Haugen said Facebook's own research had shown evidence of Instagram's harmful effects on some teenagers, and that the firm prioritised ""growth over safety"".  
Facebook said the leaks were misleading and said it had 40,000 people working on safety and security. 
Thanks to Covid, small business owners had a bleak time for much of 2021. But many of those that have survived now feel optimistic.  
The owner of the Aroma speciality coffee shop in Bologna in Italy, Cristina Caroli, was overcome with joy when tourists returned last summer.  
""It was literally a dream when we saw the first tourist after so long,"" she says. 
""Somebody speaking another language. It was very emotional. Americans! I couldn't believe it - then the English, the Swiss, the Germans - it was incredible it was fantastic!"" 
Cristina's enthusiasm for the future of her cafÃ© remains undimmed, telling me: ""Activities are starting again, the situation looks really better, it's a kind of renaissance after this bad period.""

10,11,Climate change,Geeta Pandey,Why I switched to eating grandma's food,2021-12-30,http://www.bbc.com//news/world-asia-india-59650408,"During my childhood visits to my ancestral home in rural Uttar Pradesh in northern India, I would often find my grandmother eating roti - flat bread - made with pearl millets or sorghum. 
She would mix the flour with water, take a chunk of the dough and beat it between her palms to make a big flat disc and then cook it on the wood-fired clay oven.
If she offered it to me, I'd turn my nose up. I couldn't comprehend why she'd choose them over thinner, tastier, easier-to-eat wheat rotis.
But a few years back, I switched to the food my grandma ate. 
I replaced wheat flour in my kitchen with flour made from pearl millets after I saw a report that said that the latter were healthier.
Even though my roti is now more chewy, I've stuck to it because it makes me feel healthier.
And I'm not alone - agriculture experts say in recent years, many ""forgotten foods"" are making a comeback in the farms and fields and also on our plates.
For a while now, there has been ""a concerted global effort"" to help millets shed their ""forgotten"" tag, says Dr Jacqueline Hughes, Director General of non-profit Icrisat (International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics).
India celebrated 2018 as Year of Millets and in March, the United Nations accepted Delhi's proposal to celebrate 2023 as the International Year of Millets.
Reports say the year would be used to raise awareness about the health benefits of millets and their suitability for cultivation - they can grow in degraded soil and need little pesticide - at a time when the world is confronted with the spectre of global warming.
Millets, Dr Hughes says, are increasingly being recognised as ""smart food"" because ""they are good for the planet, good for the farmer and good for you"".
""They require less water and grow in really hot temperatures. They are good for the farmer because they are very resilient and can survive pestilent diseases. They are good for you because they are more nutritious. Studies show that millets reduce diabetes, improve cholesterol profiles, alleviate calcium, zinc and iron deficiencies. They are also gluten free.""
Not surprising then that health experts in India are looking at millets with interest - the country is home to 80 million diabetics, over 17 million die from cardiovascular diseases every year and more than three million children are malnourished, half of them severely.  
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has talked of ""a millet revolution"" to ""stamp out malnutrition from the country"".
Experts say it's not an impossible task as millets were a staple for Indians for centuries.
Director of Indian Institute of Millet Research Vilas Tonapi says millets are ""the most ancient grains known to mankind"". 
""They were cultivated around 3000BC during the Indus Valley civilisation. Grown in 21 states, there are region and state specific millets which are part of the food culture and religious rituals.""
With the annual yield at 16 million tonnes, India remains the largest producer of millets in the world. But, in the past 50 years, Mr Tonapi says, the area under cultivation has shrunk from 38 million hectares to 13 million hectares and the share of millets in India's food basket has declined from 20% in the 1960s to 6% today.
The decline of millets began in 1969-70, Dr Tonapi says.
""Until then, India used to receive food aid and import large quantities of grains to feed its population. In a bid to attain food sufficiency and alleviate hunger, the government launched green revolution and introduced high-yielding varieties of rice and wheat.""
Between 1960 and 2015 in India, wheat production more than trebled, and rice production increased by 800% while millet production remained stagnant at low levels. 
Dr Hughes, who earlier this year was involved in the preparation of the Global Manifesto for Forgotten Foods, says ""this overemphasis on rice and wheat led to the neglect of millets and many traditional foods that fell by the wayside"". 
""Because they haven't been bred to modern tastes or are not easy to cook in today's fast-paced world, they have been under-utilised and neglected for decades. But it's terribly important to have diversity on your plate,"" she adds.
To do that, the ""forgotten"" crops will have to receive the same sort of attention given to rice and wheat and some of the other commercial crops. Experts say at least a beginning has been made where millets are concerned.
Several strategies suggested by agricultural scientists for their revival have begun to show results - Dr Tonapi says the demand for millets has grown by 146% in the past two years.
Millet cookies, chips, puffs and other munchies are being sold in supermarkets and online stores. The government is offering millets at one rupee a kg to millions through the public distribution system, and some state governments are serving ready-to-eat dishes as part of the school mid-day meal plan.
The renewed interest in coarse grains has come as a blessing for tribal communities in northern districts of Telangana state. 
P Aila is among a group of 10 tribal women in Asifabad who have been trained by Icrisat to prepare meals that are supplied to children in rural day-care centres.
Talking to me on the phone from her village, she lists the ingredients and spices that she uses in the meals and says that in August, they sold 12 tonnes of sweet and savoury dishes made with sorghum.  
Aila doesn't fully understand the interest in the humble grain that's been her staple all her life, but she tells me she's happy that it's going places.
